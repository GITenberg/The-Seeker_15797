<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">How the Christmas Saint was Proved</h3>

<p>The whispering died away as they heard heavy
steps and saw a line of light under the shut
door. Then a last muffled caution from the
larger boy on the cot.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, remember! There ain't any, but don't you
let <i>on</i> there ain't&mdash;else he won't bring you a single
thing!</p>

<p>&quot;Before the despairing soul on the trundle-bed could
pierce the vulnerable heel of this, the door opened
slowly to the broad shape of Clytemnestra. One hand
shaded her eyes from the candle she carried, and she
peered into the corner where the two beds were, a
flurry of eagerness in her face, checked by stoic
self-mastery.</p>

<p>At once from the older boy came the sounds of one
who breathes labouredly in deep sleep after a hard day.
But the littler boy sat rebelliously up, digging combative
fists into eyes that the light tickled. Clytemnestra
warmly rebuked him, first simulating the frown of the
irritated.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Bernal! Wide awake! My days alive! You
act like a wild Indian's little boy. This'll <i>never</i> do.
Now you go right to sleep this minute, while I watch
you. Look how fine and good Allan is.&quot; She spoke
low, not to awaken the one virtuous sleeper, who
seemed thereupon to breathe with a more swelling and
obtrusive rectitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Clytie&mdash;now&mdash;<i>ain't</i> there any Santa Claus?&quot;</p>

 <p>&quot;Now what a sinful question <i>that</i> is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But <i>is</i> there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't he bring you things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there <i>ain't</i> any!&quot; There was a sullen
desperation in this, as of one done with quibbles. But the
woman still paltered wretchedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you don't lie down and go to sleep quicker'n
a wink I bet you anything he won't bring you a single
play-pretty.&quot;</p>

<p>There came an unmistakable blare of triumph into
the busy snore on the cot.</p>

<p>But the heart of the skeptic was sunk. This evasion
was more disillusioning than downright confession. A
moment the little boy regarded her, wholly in sorrow,
with big eyes that blinked alarmingly. Then came
his last shot; the final bullet which the besieged warrior
will sometimes reserve for his own destruction. There
could no longer be any pretense between them. Bravely
he faced her.</p>

<p>&quot;Now&mdash;you just needn't try to keep it from me any
longer! I <i>know</i> there ain't any&mdash;&mdash;&quot; One tensely
tragic second he paused to gather himself&mdash;&quot;<i>It's all
over town!</i>&quot; There being nothing further to live for, he
delivered himself to grief&mdash;to be tortured and destroyed.</p>

<p>Clytie set the candle on the bureau and came to
hover him. Within the pressing arms and upon the
proffered bosom he wept out one of those griefs that
may not be told&mdash;that only the heart can understand.
Yet, when the first passion of it was spent she began to
reassure him, begging him not to be misled by idle
gossip; to take not even her own testimony, but to wait
and see what he would see. At last he listened and was
a little soothed. It appeared that Santa Claus was one
you might believe in or might not. Even Clytie
seemed to be puzzled about him. He could see that
she overflowed with belief in him, yet he could not
make her confess it in plain straight words. The
meat of it was that good children found things on
Christmas morning which must have been left by
some one&mdash;if not by Santa Claus, then by whom? Did
the little boy believe, for example, that Milo Barrus
did it? He was the village atheist, and so bad a man
that he loved to spell God with a little g.</p>

<p>He mused upon this while his tears dried, finding it
plausible. Of course it couldn't be Milo Barrus, so
it <i>must</i> be Santa Claus. Was Clytie certain some
presents would be there in the morning? If he went
directly to sleep, she was.</p>

<p>Hereupon the larger boy on the cot, who had for
some moments listened in forgetful silence, became
again virtuously asleep in a public manner.</p>

<p>But the littler boy must yet have talk. Could the
bells of Santa Claus be heard when he came?</p>

<p>Clytie had known some children, of exceptional merit,
it was true, who claimed to have heard his bells on
certain nights when they had gone early to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Why</i> would he never leave anything for a child that
got up out of bed and caught him at it? Suppose one
had to get up for a drink.</p>

<p>Because it broke the charm.</p>

<p>But if a very, <i>very</i> good child just <i>happened</i> to wake
up while he was in the room, and didn't pay the least
attention to him, or even look sidewise or anything&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Even this were hazardous, it seemed; though if the
child were indeed very good all might not yet be lost.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, won't you leave the light for me? The dark
gets in my eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>But this was another adverse condition, making
everything impossible. So she chided and reassured
him, tucked the covers once more about his neck, and
left him, with a final comment on the advantage of
sleeping at once.</p>

<p>When the room was dark and Clytie's footsteps had
sounded down the hall, he called softly to his brother;
but that wise child was now truly asleep. So the littler
boy lay musing, having resolved to stay awake and solve
the mystery once for all.</p>

<p>From wondering what he might receive he came to
wondering if he were good. His last meditation was
upon the Sunday-school book his dear mother had
helped him read before they took her away with a new
little baby that had never amounted to much; before he
and Allan came to Grandfather Delcher's to live&mdash;
where there was a great deal to eat. The name of the
book was &quot;Ben Holt.&quot; He remembered this especially
because a text often quoted in the story said &quot;A good
name is rather to be chosen than great riches.&quot; He
had often wondered why Ben Holt should be considered
an especially good name; and why Ben Holt
came to choose it instead of the goldpiece he found and
returned to the schoolmaster, before he fell sick and
was sent away to the country where the merry haymakers
were. Of course, there were worse names than
Ben Holt. It was surely better than Eygji Watts,
whose sanguine parents were said to have named him
with the first five letters they drew from a hat containing
the alphabet; Ben Holt was assuredly better than
Eygji, even had this not been rendered into &quot;Hedge-hog&quot;
by careless companions. His last confusion of
ideas was a wondering if Bernal Linford was as good a
name as Ben Holt, and why he could not remember
having chosen it in preference to a goldpiece. Back of
this, in his fading consciousness was the high-coloured
image of a candy cane, too splendid for earth.</p>

<p>Then, far in the night, as it might have seemed to the
little boy, came the step of slippered feet. This time
Clytie, satisfying herself that both boys slept, set down
her candle and went softly out, leaving the door open.
There came back with her one bearing gifts&mdash;a tall,
dark old man, with a face of many deep lines and severe
set, who yet somehow shed kindness, as if he held a
spirit of light prisoned within his darkness, so that,
while only now and then could a visible ray of it escape
through the sombre eye or through a sudden winning
quality in the harsh voice, it nevertheless radiated from
him sensibly at all times, to belie his sternness and puzzle
those who feared him.</p>

<p>Uneasy enough he looked now as Clytie unloaded him
of the bundles and bulky toys. In a silence broken
only by their breathing they quickly bestowed the gifts
&mdash;some in the hanging stockings at the fire-place, others
beside each bed, in chairs or on the mantel.</p>

<p>Then they were in the hall again, the door closed so
that they could speak. The old man took up his own
candle from a stand against the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;The little one is like her,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;He's awful cunning and bright, but Allan is the
handsomest. Never in my born days did I see so
beautiful a boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he's like the father, line for line.&quot; There was a
sudden savage roughness in the voice, a sterner set to
the shaven upper lip and straight mouth, though he
still spoke low. &quot;Like the huckstering, godless fiddle-player
that took her away from me. What a mercy of
God's he'll never see her again&mdash;she with the saved
and he&mdash;what a reckoning for him when he goes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he was not bad to let you take them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He boasted to me that he'd not have done it, except
that she begged him with her last breath to promise
it. He said the words with great maudlin tears raining
down his face, when my own eyes were dry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How good if you can leave them both in the church,
preaching the word where you preached it so many
years!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I misdoubt the father's blood in them&mdash;at least, in
the older. But it's late. Good night, Clytie&mdash;a good
Christmas to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;More to you, Mr. Delcher! Good night!&quot;</p>
<br>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">An Old Man Faces Two Ways</h3>

<p>His candle up, he went softly along the white hallway
over the heavy red carpet, to where a door at the
end, half-open, let him into his study. Here a wood
fire at the stage of glowing coals made a searching
warmth. Blowing out his candle, he seated himself
at the table where a shaded lamp cast its glare upon a
litter of books and papers. A big, white-breasted
gray cat yawned and stretched itself from the hearthrug
and leaped lightly upon him with great rumbling
purrs, nosing its head under one of his hands suggestively,
and, when he stroked it, looking up at him
with lazily falling eye-lids.</p>

<p>He crossed his knees to make a better lap for the cat,
and fell to musing backward into his own boyhood,
when the Christmas Saint was a real presence. Then
he came forward to his youth, when he had obeyed the
call of the Lord against his father's express command
that he follow the family way and become a prosperous
manufacturer. Truly there had been revolt in him.
Perhaps he had never enough considered this in excuse
for his own daughter's revolt.</p>

<p>Again he dwelt in the days when he had preached
with a hot passion such truth as was his. For a long
time, while the old clock ticked on the mantel before
him and the big cat purred or slept under his absent
pettings, his mind moved through an incident of that
early ministry. Clear in his memory were certain
passages of fire from the sermon. In the little log
church at Edom he had felt the spirit burn in him and
he had movingly voiced its warnings of that dread place
where the flames forever blaze, yet never consume;
where cries ever go up for one drop of water to cool the
parched tongues of those who sought not God while
they lived. He had told of one who died&mdash;one that the
world called good, a moral man&mdash;but not a Christian;
one who had perversely neglected the way of life.
How, on his death-bed, this one had called in agony
for a last glass of water, seeming to know all at once
that he would now be where no drop of water could
cool him through all eternity.</p>

<p>So effective had been his putting of this that a
terrified throng came forward at his call for converts.</p>
<p>The next morning he had ridden away from Edom
toward Felton Falls to preach there. A mile out of
town he had been accosted by a big, bearded man who
had yet a singularly childish look&mdash;who urged that he
come to his cabin to minister to a sick friend. He
knew the fellow for one that the village of Edom called
&quot;daft&quot; or &quot;queer,&quot; yet held to be harmless&mdash;to be
rather amusing, indeed, since he could be provoked
to deliver curious harangues upon the subject of
revealed religion. He remembered now that the man's
face had stared at him from far back in the church the
night before&mdash;a face full of the liveliest terror, though
he had not been among those that fled to the mercy-seat.
Acceding to the man's request, he followed him
up a wooded path to his cabin. Dismounting and
tying his horse, he entered and, turning to ask where
the sick man was, found himself throttled in the grasp
of a giant.</p>

<p>He was thrust into an inner room, windowless and
with no door other than the one now barred by his
chuckling captor. And here the Reverend Allan
Delcher had lain three days and two nights captive of a
madman, with no food and without one drop of water.</p>
<p>From the other side of the log partition his captor
had declared himself to be the keeper of hell. Even
now he could hear the words maundered through
the chinks: &quot;Never got another drop of water for a
million years and <i>still</i> more, and him a burning up and
a roasting up, and his tongue a lolling out, all of a
<i>sizzle</i>. Now wasn't that fine&mdash;because folks said he'd
likely gone crazy about religion!&quot;</p>

<p>Other times his captor would declare himself to be
John the Baptist making straight the paths in the
wilderness. Again he would quote passages of
scripture, some of them hideous mockeries to the
tortured prisoner, some strangely soothing and suggestive.</p>

<p>But a search had been made for the missing man
and, quite by accident, they had found him, at a time
when it seemed to him his mind must go with his
captor's. His recovery from the physical blight of
this captivity had been prompt; but there were those
who sat under him who insisted that ever after he had
been palpably less insistent upon the feature of divine
retribution for what might be called the merely technical
sins of heterodoxy. Not that unsound doctrine was
ever so much as hinted of him; only, as once averred a
plain parishioner, &quot;He seemed to bear down on hell
jest a <i>lee-tle</i> less continuously.&quot;</p>

<p>As for his young wife, she had ever after professed an
unconquerable aversion for those sermons in which
God's punishment of sinners was set forth; and this
had strangely been true of their daughter, born but a
little time after the father's release from the maniac's
cabin. She had grown to womanhood submitting
meekly to an iron rule; but none the less betraying an
acute repugnance for certain doctrines preached by her
father. It seemed to the old man a long way to look
back; and then a long way to come forward again, past
the death of his girl-wife while their child was still
tender, down to the amazing iniquity of that child's
revolt, in her thirty-first year. Dumbly, dutifully, had
she submitted to all his restrictions and severities,
stonily watching her girlhood go, through a fading,
lining and hardening of her prettiness. Then all at
once, with no word of pleading or warning, she had
done the monstrous thing. He awoke one day to
know that his beloved child had gone away to marry
the handsome, swaggering, fiddle-playing good-for-nothing
who had that winter given singing lessons in
the village.</p>

<p>Only once after that had he looked upon her face&mdash;
the face of a withered sprite, subdued by time. The
hurt of that look was still fresh in him, making his
mind turn heavily, perhaps a little remorsefully, to
the two little boys asleep in the west bedroom. Had
the seed of revolt been in her, from his own revolt
against his father? Would it presently bear some ugly
fruit in her sons?</p>

<p>From a drawer in the table he took a little sheaf of
folded sheets, and read again the last letter that had
come from her; read it not without grim mutterings and
oblique little jerks of the narrow old head, yet with
quick tender glows melting the sternness.</p>

<p>&quot;You must not think I have ever regretted my choice,
though every day of my life I have sorrowed at your
decision not to see me so long as I stayed by my husband.
How many times I have prayed God to remind you
that I took him for better or worse, till death should us
part.&quot;</p>

<p>This made him mutter.</p>

<p>&quot;Clayton has never in his life failed of kindness and
gentleness to me&quot;&mdash;so ran the letter&mdash;&quot;and he has
always provided for us as well as a man of his <i>uncommon
talents</i> could.&quot;</p>

<p>Here the old man sniffed in fine contempt.</p>

<p>&quot;All last winter he had quite a class to teach singing
in the evening and three day-scholars for the violin, one
of whom paid him in hams. Another offered to pay
either in money or a beautiful portrait of me in pastel.
We needed money, but Clayton chose the portrait as a
surprise to me. At times he seems unpractical, but
now he has started out in <i>business</i> again&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>There were bitter shakings of the head here. Business!
Standing in a buggy at street-corners, jauntily
urging a crowd to buy the magic grease-eradicator,
toothache remedy, meretricious jewelry, what not!
first playing a fiddle and rollicking out some ribald
song to fetch them. Business indeed! A pretty
business!</p>

<p>&quot;The boys are delighted with the Bibles you sent and
learn a verse each day. I have told them they may
some day preach as you did if they will be as good men
as you are and study the Bible. They try to preach
like our preacher in the cunningest way. I wish you
could see them. You would love them in spite of your
feeling against their father. I did what you suggested
to stimulate their minds about the Scriptures, but
perhaps the lesson they chose to write about was not
very edifying. It does not seem a pretty lesson to me,
and I did not pick it out. They heard about it at
Sabbath-school and had their papers all written as a
surprise for me. Of course, Bernal's is <i>very</i> childish,
but I think Allan's paper, for a child of his age, shows a
<i>grasp</i> of religious matters that is <i>truly remarkable</i>. I
shall keep them studying the Bible daily. I should tell
you that I am now looking forward with great joy
to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>With a long sigh he laid down the finely written sheet
and took from the sheaf the two papers she had spoken
of. Then while the gale roared without and shook his
window, and while the bust of John Calvin looked
down at him from the book-case at his back, he followed
his two grandsons on their first incursion into
the domain of speculative theology.</p>

<p>He took first the paper of the older boy, painfully
elaborated with heavy, intricate capitals and headed
&quot;Elisha and the Wicked Children&mdash;by Mr. Allan
Delcher Linford, Esquire, aged nine years and six
months.&quot;</p>

<br>

<blockquote><p>&quot;This lesson,&quot; it began, &quot;is to teach us to love God
and the prophets or else we will likely get into trouble.
It says Elisha went up from Bethel and some children
came out of the city and said go up thou Baldhead.
They said it Twice one after the other and so Elisha got
mad right away and turned around and cursed them
good in the name of the Lord and so 2 She Bears come
along and et up 42 of them for Elisha was a holy
prophet of God and had not ought to of been yelled at.
So of course the mothers would Take on very much
When they found their 42 Children et up but I think
that we had ought to learn from this that these 42
Little ones was not the Elected. It says in our catchism
God having out of his mere good pleasure
elected some to everlasting life. Now God being a
Presbiterian would know these 42 little ones had not
been elected so they might as well be et up by bears as
anything else to show forth his honour and glory Forever
Amen. It should teach a Boy to be mighty
carful about kidding old men unless he is a Presbiterian.
I spelled every word in this right.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 15em; font-variant: small-caps;">Mr. Allan Delcher Linford.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<p>The second paper, which the old man now held long
before him, was partly printed and partly written with
a lead-pencil, whose mark was now faint and now
heavy, as having gone at intervals to the writer's lips.
As the old man read, his face lost not a little of its
grimness.</p>

<br>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center; font-variant: small-caps;">&quot;Bears</p>

<p>&quot;It teaches the lord thy God is baldheaded. I ask
my deer father what it teeches he said it teeches who
ever wrot that storry was baldheaded. He says a man
with thik long hair like my deer father would of said
o let the kids have their fun with old Elisha so I ask
my deer mother who wrot this lesson she said God wrot
the holy word so that is how we know God is baldheaded.
It was a lot of children for only two 2 bears.
I liked to of ben there if the bears wold of known that I
was a good child. mabe I cold of ben on a high
fense or up a tree. I climd the sor aple tree in our back yard esy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 15em;">By <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Bernal Linford</span>, aged neerly 8 yrs.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<p>Carefully he put back both papers with the mother's
letter, his dark face showing all its intricate net-work of
lines in a tension that was both pained and humorous.</p>

<p>Two fresh souls were given to his care to be made,
please God, the means of grace by which thousands of
other souls might be washed clean of the stain of
original sin. Yet, if revolt was there&mdash;revolt like his
daughter's and like his own? Would he forgive as his
own father had forgiven, who had called him back after
many years to live out a tranquil old age on the fortune
that father's father had founded? He mused long on
this. The age was lax&mdash;true, but God's law was never
lax. If one would revolt from the right, one must
suffer. For the old man was one of the few last of a
race of giants who were to believe always in the Printed
Word.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Cult of the Candy Cane</h3>

<p>When the littler boy looked fairly into the frosty
gray of that Christmas morning, the trailed banner
of his faith was snatched once more aloft; and in the breast
of his complacent brother there swelled the conviction
that one does ill to flaunt one's skepticism, when the
rewards of belief are substantial and imminent. For
before them was an array of gifts such as neither had
ever looked upon before, save as forbidden treasure of
the few persons whose immense wealth enables them
to keep toy-shops.</p>

<p>The tale of the princely Saint was now authenticated
delightfully. That which had made him seem unreal
in moments of spiritual laxity&mdash;the impenetrable
secrecy of his private life&mdash;was now seen to enhance
manyfold his wondrous givings. Here was a charm
which could never have sat the display before them
had it been dryly bought in their presence from one
of the millionaire toy-shop keepers. For a wondering
moment they looked from their beds, sputtering,
gibbering, gasping, with cautious calls one to the
other. Then having proved speech to be no disenchantment
they shouted and laughed crazily. There
followed a scramble from the beds and a swift return
from the cold, each bearing such of the priceless bits as
had lain nearest. And while these were fondled or
shot or blown upon or tasted or wound up, each according
to its wonderful nature, they looked farther
afield seeing other and ever new packages bulk mysteriously
into the growing light; bundles quickening
before their eyes with every delight to be imagined of a
Saint with epicurean tastes and prodigal habits&mdash;
bundles that looked as if a mere twitch at the cord
would expose their hidden charms.</p>

<p>The littler boy now wore a unique fur cap that let
down to cover the neck and face, with openings wonderfully
contrived for the eyes, nose and mouth&mdash;an easy
triumph, surely, over the deadliest cold known to man.
In one hand he flourished a brass-handled knife with
both of its blades open; with the other he clasped a
striped trumpet, into the china mouthpiece of which
he had blown the shreds of a caramel, not meaning to;
and here he was made to forget these trifles by discovering
at the farther side of the room a veritable
rocking-horse, a creature that looked not only magnificently
willing, but superbly untamable, with a white
mane and tail of celestial flow, with alert, pointed ears
of maroon leather nailed nicely to the right spot. At
this marvel he stared in that silence which is the
highest power of joy: a presentiment had been his that
such a horse, curveting on blue rockers, would be found
on this very morning. Two days before had he in an
absent moment beheld a vision of this horse poised near
the door of the attic; but when he ran to make report of
it below, thinking to astound people by his power of
insight, Clytemnestra, bidding him wait in the kitchen
where she was baking, had hurried to the spot and
found only some rolls of blue cambric. She had
rather shamed him for giving her such a start. A few
rolls of shiny blue cambric against a white wall did not,
she assured him, make a rocking-horse; and, what was
more, they never would. Now the vision came back
with a significance that set him all a-thrill. Next time
Clytie would pay attention to him. He laughed to
think of her confusion now.</p>

<p>But here again, at the very zenith of a shout, was he
frozen to silence by a vision&mdash;this time one too obviously
of no ponderable fabric. There in the corner, almost
at his hand, seemed to be a thing that he had dreamed
of possessing only after he entered Heaven&mdash;a candy
cane: one of fearful length, thick of girth, vast of crook,
and wide in the spiral stripe that seemed to run a
living flame before his ravished eyes, beginning at the
bottom and winding around and around the whole
dizzy height. Fearfully in nerve-braced silence he
leaned far out of his bed to bring against this amazing
apparition one cool, impartial forefinger of skeptic
research. It did not vanish; it resisted his touch.
Then his heart fainted with rapture, for he knew the
unimagined had become history.</p>

<p>Standing before the windows of the great, he had
gazed long at these creations. They were suspended on
a wire across the window in various lengths, from little
ones to sizes too awesome to compute. On one occasion
so long had he stood motionless, so deep the trance
of his contemplation, that the winter cold had cruelly
bitten his ears and toes. He had not supposed that
these things were for mere vulgar ownership. He had
known of boys who had guns and building-blocks and
rocking-horses as well as candy in the lesser degrees;
but never had he known, never had he been able to hear
of one who had owned a thing like this. Indeed,
among the boys he knew, it was believed that they
were not even to be seen save on their wire at Christmas
time in the windows of the rich. One boy had hinted
that the &quot;set&quot; would not be broken even if a person
should appear with money enough to buy a single one.
And here before him was the finest of them all, receding
neither from his gaze or his touch, one as long as the
longest of which Heaven had hitherto vouchsafed him
a chilling vision through glass; here was the same
fascinating union of transcendent merit with a playful
suggestion of downright utility. And he had blurted
out to Clytie that the news of there being no Santa
Claus was all over town! He was ashamed, and the
moment became for him one of chastening in which he
humbled his unbelieving spirit before this symbol of a
more than earthly goodness&mdash;a symbol in whose presence,
while as yet no accident had rendered it less than
perfect, he would never cease to feel the spiritual
uplift of one who has weighed the fruits of faith and
found them not wanting.</p>

<p>He issued from some bottomless stupor of ecstacy to
hear the door open to Allan's shouts; then to see
the opening nicely filled again by the figure of Clytemnestra,
who looked over at them with eager, shining
eyes. He was at first powerless to do more than say
&quot;Oh, Clytie!&quot; with little impotent pointings toward
the candy cane. But the action now in order served
to restore him to a state of working sanity. There was
washing and dressing after Clytie had the fire crackling;
the forgetting of some treasures to remember others;
and the conveyance of them all down stairs to the big
sitting-room where the sun came in over the geraniums
in the bay-window, and where the Franklin heater
made the air tropic. The rocking-horse was led and
pushed by both boys; but to Clytie's responsible hand
alone was intrusted the more than earthly candy cane.</p>

<p>Downstairs there was the grandfather to greet&mdash;
erect, fresh-shaven, flashing kind eyes from under
stern brows. He seemed to be awkwardly pleased
with their pleasure, yet scarce able to be one with
them; as if that inner white spirit of his fluttered more
than its wont to be free, yet found only tiny exits for
its furtive flashes of light.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a chattering and explosive meal, a
severe trial, indeed, to the patience of the littler boy,
who decided that he wished never to eat breakfast again.
During the ten days that he had been a member of the
household a certain formality observed at the beginning
of each meal had held him in abject fascination, so that
he looked forward to it with pleased terror. This was
that, when they were all seated, there ensued a pause
of precisely two seconds&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;a pause
that became awful by reason of the fact that every one
grew instantly solemn and expectant&mdash;even apprehensive.
His tingling nerves had defined his spine for him
before this pause ended, and then, when the roots of his
hair began to crinkle, his grandfather would suddenly
bow low over his plate and rumble in his head. It was
very curious and weirdly pleasurable, and it lasted one
minute. When it ceased the tension relaxed instantly,
and every one was friendly and cordial and safe again.</p>

<p>This morning the little boy was actually impatient
during the rumble, so eager was he to talk. And not
until he had been assured by both his grandfather and
Clytie that Santa Claus meant everything he left to be
truly kept; that he came back for nothing&mdash;not even
for a cane&mdash;<i>of any kind</i>&mdash;that he might have left at a
certain house by mistake&mdash;not until then would he
heave the sigh of immediate security and consent to
eat his egg and muffins, of which latter Clytie had to
bring hot ones from the kitchen because both boys
had let the first plate go cold. For Clytie, like Grandfather
Delcher, was also one of the last of a race of
American giants&mdash;in her case a race preceding servants,
that called itself &quot;hired girls&quot;&mdash;who not only ate with
the family, but joyed and sorrowed with it and for
long terms of years was a part of it in devotion,
responsibility and self-respect. She had, it is true,
dreaded the coming of these children, but from the
moment that the two cold, subdued little figures had
looked in doubting amazement at the four kinds of
preserves and three kinds of cake set out for their first
collation in the new home, she had rejoiced unceasingly
in a vicarious motherhood.</p>

<p>Within an hour after breakfast the morning's find
had been examined, appraised, and accorded perpetual
rank by merit. Grandfather Delcher made but one
timid effort to influence decisions.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Bernal, which do you like best of all your
presents?&quot; he asked. With a heart too full for words
the littler boy had pointed promptly but shyly at his
candy cane. Not once, indeed, had he been able to
say the words &quot;candy cane.&quot; It was a creation which
mere words were inadequate to name. It was a
presence to be pointed at. He pointed again firmly
when the old man asked, &quot;Are you quite certain, now,
you like it best of all?&quot;&mdash;suggestively&mdash;&quot;better than
this fine book with this beautiful picture of Joseph
being sold away by his wicked brothers?&quot;</p>

<p>The questioner had turned then to the older boy,
who tactfully divined that a different answer would
have pleased the old man better.</p>

<p>&quot;And what do you like best, Allan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I like this fine and splendid book best of all!&quot;
&mdash;and he read from the title-page, in the clear, confident
tones of the pupil who knows that the teacher's favour
rests upon him&mdash;&quot;'From Eden to Calvary; or through
the Bible in a year with our boys and girls; a book of
pleasure and profit for young persons on Sabbath
Afternoon. By Grandpa Silas Atterbury, the well-known
author and writer for young people.&quot;</p>

<p>His glance toward his brother at the close was meant
to betray the consciousness of his own superiority to
one who dallied sensuously with created objects.</p>

<p>But the unspiritual one was riding the new horse
at a furious gallop, and the glance of reproof was
unnoted save by the old man&mdash;who wondered if it
might be by any absurd twist that the boy most like
the godless father were more godly than the one so like
his mother that every note of his little voice and every
full glance of his big blue eyes made the old heart
flutter.</p>

<p>In the afternoon came callers from the next house;
Dr. Crealock, rubicund and portly, leaning on his
cane, to pass the word of seasonable cheer with his old
friend and pastor; and with him his tiny niece to greet
the grandchildren of his friend. The Doctor went
with his host to the study on the second floor, where,
as a Christmas custom, they would drink some Madeira,
ancient of days, from a cask prescribed and furnished
long since by the doctor.</p>

<p>The little boy was for the moment left alone with
the tiny niece; to stare curiously, now that she was
close, at one of whom he had caught glimpses in a
window of the big house next door. She was clad in
a black velvet cloak and hood, with pink satin next her
face inside the hood, and she carried a large closely-wrapped
doll which she affected to think might have
taken cold. With great self-possession she doffed her
cloak and overshoes; then slowly and tenderly unwound
the wrappings of the doll, talking meanwhile in low
mothering tones, and going with it to the fire when she
had it uncloaked. Of the boy who stared at her she
seemed unconscious, and he could do no more than
stand timidly at a little distance. An eye-flash from
the maid may have perceived his abjectness, for she
said haughtily at length, &quot;I'm astonished no one in this
house knows where Clytie is!&quot;</p>

<p>He drew nearer by as far as he could slowly spread
his feet twice.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I</i> know&mdash;now&mdash;she went to get two glasses from
the dresser to take to my grandfather and that gentleman.&quot;
He felt voluble from the mere ease of the
answer. But she affected to have heard nothing, and
he was obliged to speak again.</p>

<p>&quot;Now&mdash;why, <i>I</i> know a doll that shuts up her eyes
every time she lies down.&quot;</p>

<p>The doll at hand was promptly extended on the little
lap and with a click went into sudden sleep while the
mother rocked it. He could have ventured nothing
more after this pricking of his inflated little speech. A
moment he stood, suffering moderately, and then would
have edged cautiously away with the air of wishing to
go, only at this point, without seeming to see him, she
chirped to him quite winningly in a soft, warm little
voice, and there was free talk at once. He manfully let
her tell of all her silly little presents before talking of
his own. He even listened about the doll, whose name
Santa Claus had thoughtfully painted on the box in
which she came; it was a French name, &quot;Fragile.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, being come to names, they told their own.
Hers, she said, was Lillian May.</p>

<p>&quot;But your uncle, now&mdash;that gentleman&mdash;he called
you <i>Nancy</i> when you came in.&quot; He waited for her
solving of this.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Doctor doesn't know it yet, what my
<i>real</i> name is. They call me Nancy, but that's a very
disagreeable name, so I took Lillian May for my real
name. But I tell <i>very</i> few persons,&quot; she added, importantly.
Here he was at home; he knew about
choosing a good name.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you give up the gold-piece you found?&quot; he
asked. But this puzzled her.</p>

<p>&quot;'A good name is rather to be chosen than great
riches,'&quot; he reminded her. &quot;Didn't you find a gold-piece
like Ben Holt did?&quot;</p>

<p>But it seemed she had never found anything. Indeed,
once she had lost a dime, even on the way to spending
it for five candy bananas and five jaw-breakers.
Plainly she had chosen her good name without knowing
of the case of Ben Holt. Then he promised to show
her something the most wonderful in all the world,
which she would never believe without seeing it, and led
her to where the candy cane towered to their shoulders
in its corner. He saw at once that it meant less to her
than it did to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's a candy cane!&quot; she said, <i>calling</i> it a candy
cane commonly, with not even a hush of tone, as one
would say &quot;a brick house&quot; or &quot;a gold watch,&quot; or
anything. She, promptly detecting his disappointment
at her coldness, tried to simulate the fervour of an
initiate, but this may never be done so as to deceive any
one who has truly sensed the occult and incommunicable
virtue of the candy cane. For one thing, she kept
repeating the words &quot;candy cane&quot; baldly, whenever she
could find a place for them in her soulless praise;
whereas an initiate would not once have uttered the
term, but would have looked in silence. Another
initiate, equally silent by his side, would have known
him to be of the brotherhood. Perhaps at the end
there would have been respectful wonder expressed as
to how long it would stay unbroken and so untasted.
Still he was not unkind to her, except in ways requisite
to a mere decent showing forth of his now ascertained
superiority. He helped her to a canter on the new
horse; and even pretended a polite and superficial
interest in the doll, Fragile, which she took up often.
Being a girl, she had to be humoured in that manner.
But any boy could see that the thing went to sleep by
turning its eyes inside out, <i>and its garters were painted
on its fat legs</i>. These things he was, of course, too
much the gentleman to point out.</p>

<p>When the Doctor and his host came down stairs late
in the afternoon, the little boy and girl were fairly
friendly. Only there was talk of kissing at the door,
started by the little girl's uncle, and this the little boy
of course could not consider, even though he suddenly
wished it of all things&mdash;for he had never kissed any
one but his father and mother. He had told Clytie it
made him sick to be kissed. Now, when the little girl
called to him as if it were the simplest thing in the world,
he could not go. And then she stabbed him by falsely
kissing the complacent Allan standing by, who thereupon
smirked in sickening deprecation and promptly
rubbed his cheek.</p>

<p>Not until the pair were out in the street did his man-strength
come back to him, and then he could only burn
with indignation at her and at Allan. He wondered
that no one was shocked at him for feeling as he did.
But, as they seemed not to notice him, he rode his horse
again. No mad gallop now, but a slow, moody jog&mdash;a
pace ripe for any pessimism.</p>

<p>&quot;Clytie!&quot; he called imperiously, after a little. &quot;Do
you think there's a real bone in this horse&mdash;like a
<i>regular</i> horse?&quot;</p>

<p>Clytie responded from the dining-room with a
placid &quot;I guess so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I sawed into its neck, would the saw go right
into a real <i>bone</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My suz! what talk! Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know there <i>ain't</i> any bone in there, like a regular
horse. It's just a <i>wooden</i> bone.&quot;</p>

<p>Nor was this his last negative thought of the day.
It came to him then and there with cruel, biting plainness,
that no one else in the house felt as he did toward
his chief treasure. Allan didn't. He had spent
hardly a moment with it. Clytie didn't; he had seen
her pick it up when she dusted the sitting-room; there
was sacrilege in her very grasp of it; and his grandfather
seemed hardly to know of its existence. The little
girl who had chosen the good name of Lillian May
might have been excused; but not these others. If
his grandfather was without understanding in such a
matter, in what, then, could he be trusted?</p>

<p>He descended to a still lower plane before he fell
asleep that night. Even if he had <i>one</i> of them, he
would probably never have a whole row, graduated
from a pigmy to a mammoth, to hang on a wire across
the front window, after the manner of the rich, and
dazzle the outer world into envy. The mood was but
slightly chastened when he remembered, as he now did,
that on last Christmas he had received only one pretentious
candy rooster, falsely hollow, and a very
uninteresting linen handkerchief embroidered with
some initials not his own. He fell asleep on a brutal
reflection that the cane could be broken accidentally
and eaten.</p>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Big House of Portents</h3>

<p>In this big white house the little boys had been born
again to a life that was all strange. Novel was the outer
house with its high portico and fluted pillars, its vast
areas of white wall set with shutters of relentless green;
its stout, red chimneys; its surprises of gabled window;
its big front door with the polished brass knocker and
the fan-light above. Quite as novel was the inner
house, and quite as novel was this new life to its very
center.</p>

<p>For one thing, while the joy of living had hitherto been
all but flawless for the little boys, the disadvantages of
being dead were now brought daily to their notice. In
morning and evening prayer, in formal homily, informal
caution, spontaneous warning, in the sermon at church,
and the lesson of the Sabbath-school, was their excessive
liability to divine wrath impressed upon them
&quot;when the memory is wax to receive and marble
to retain.&quot;</p>

<p>Within the home Clytie proved to be an able coadjutor
of the old man, who was, indeed, constrained and
awkward in the presence of the younger child, and
perhaps a thought too severe with the elder. But
Clytie, who had said &quot;I'll make my own of them,&quot; was
tireless and not without ingenuity in opening the way
of life to their little feet.</p>

<p>Allan, the elder, gifted with a distinct talent for
memorising, she taught many instructive bits chosen
from the scrap-book in which her literary treasures
were preserved. His rendition of a passage from one of
Mr. Spurgeon's sermons became so impressive under
her drilling that the aroma of his lost youth stole back
to the nostrils of the old man while he listened.</p>

<p>&quot;There is a place,&quot; the boy would declaim loweringly,
and with fitting gesture, with hypnotic eye fastened on
the cowering Bernal, &quot;where the only music is the
symphony of damned souls. Where howling, groaning,
moaning, and gnashing of teeth make up the horrible
concert. There is a place where demons fly swift as
air, with whips of knotted burning wire, torturing poor
souls; where tongues on fire with agony burn the roofs
of mouths that shriek in vain for drops of water&mdash;that
water all denied. When thou diest, O Sinner&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>But at this point the smaller boy usually became restless
and would have to go to the kitchen for a drink of
water. Always he became thirsty here. And he would
linger over his drink till Clytie called him back to admire
his brother in the closing periods.</p>

<p>&mdash;&quot;but at the resurrection thy soul will be united to
thy body and then thou wilt have twin hells; body and
soul will be tormented together, each brimful of agony,
the soul sweating in its utmost pores drops of blood, thy
body from head to foot suffused with pain, thy bones
cracking in the fire, thy pulse rattling at an enormous
rate in agony, every nerve a string on which the devil
shall play his diabolical tune of hell's unutterable
torment.&quot;</p>

<p>Here the little boy always listened at his wrist to
know if his pulse rattled yet, and felt glad indeed that
he was a Presbyterian, instead of being in that dreadful
place with Jews and Papists and Milo Barrus, who
spelled God with a little g.</p>

<p>As to his own performance, Clytie found that he
memorised prose with great difficulty. A week did
she labour to teach him one brief passage from a
lecture of Francis Murphy, depicting the fate of the
drunkard. She bribed him to fresh effort with every
carnal lure the pantry afforded, but invariably he
failed at a point where the soul of the toper was going
&quot;down&mdash;<i>down</i>&mdash;DOWN&mdash;into the bottomless depths
of HELL!&quot; Here he became pitiful in his ineffectiveness,
and Clytie had at last to admit that he would
never be the elocutionist Allan was. &quot;But, my Land!&quot;
she would say, at each of his failures, &quot;if you only <i>could</i>
do it the way Mr. Murphy did&mdash;and then he'd talk
so plain and natural, too,&mdash;just like he was associating
with a body in their own parlour&mdash;and so pathetic it
made a body simply bawl. My suz! how I did love to
set and hear that man tell what a sot he'd been!&quot;</p>
<p>However, Clytie happily discovered that the littler
boy's memory was more tenacious of rhyme, so she
successfully taught him certain metrical conceits that
had been her own to learn in girlhood, beginning with
pithy couplets such as:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;Xerxes the Great did die<br>
&nbsp;And so must you and I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As runs the glass<br>
&nbsp;Man's life must pass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy life to mend<br>
&nbsp;God's book attend.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>From these it was a step entirely practicable to
longer warnings, one of her favourites being:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p class="sc">Uncertainty Of Life</p>
<p>&quot;I in the burying-place may see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graves shorter there than I.<br>
&nbsp;From Death's arrest no age is free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young children, too, may die.</p>
<p>&quot;My God, may such an awful sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakening be to me;<br>
&nbsp;Oh, that by early grace, I might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For death prepared be!&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>She was not a little proud of Bernal the day he
recited this to Grandfather Delcher without a break,
though he began the second stanza somewhat timidly,
because it sounded so much like swearing.</p>

<p>Nor did she neglect to teach both boys the lessons of
Holy Writ.</p>

<p>Of a Sabbath afternoon she would read how God
ordered the congregation to stone the son of Shelomith
for blasphemy; or, perhaps, how David fetched the
Ark of the Covenant from Kirjath-jearim on a new
cart; and of how the Lord &quot;made a breach&quot; upon Uzza
for wickedly putting his hand upon the Ark to save it
when the oxen stumbled. The little boys were much
impressed by this when they discovered, after questioning,
exactly what it meant to Uzza to have &quot;a breach&quot;
made upon him. The unwisdom of touching an Ark
of the Covenant, under any circumstances, could not
have been more clearly brought home to them. They
liked also to hear of the instruments played upon before
the Lord by those that went ahead of the Ark; harps,
psalteries, and timbrels; cornets, cymbals, and instruments
made of fir-wood.</p>

<p>Then there was David, who danced at the head of
the procession &quot;girded with a linen ephod,&quot; which,
somehow, sounded insufficient; and indeed, it appeared
that Clytie was inclined to side wholly with Michal,
David's wife, who looked through a window and despised
him when she saw him &quot;leaping and dancing before the
Lord,&quot; uncovered save for the presumably inadequate
ephod of linen. She, Clytie, thought it not well that
a man of David's years and honour should &quot;make
himself ridiculous that way.&quot;</p>

<p>So it was early in this new life that the little boys came
to walk as it behooves those to walk who shall taste
death. And to the littler boy, prone to establish relations
and likenesses among his mental images, the
big house itself would at times be more than itself to
him. There was the Front Room. Only the use of
capital letters can indicate the manner in which he was
accustomed to regard it. Each Friday, when it was
opened for a solemn dusting, he timidly pierced its
stately gloom from the threshold of its door. It
seemed to be an abode of dead joys&mdash;a place where they
had gone to reign forever in fixed and solemn festival.
And while he could not see God there, actually, neither
in the horsehair sofa nor the bleak melodeon surmounted
by tall vases of dyed grass, nor in the center-table
with its cemeterial top, nor under the empty horsehair
and green-rep chairs, set at expectant angles, nor
in the cold, tall stove, ornately set with jewels of
polished nickel, and surely not in the somewhat frivolous
air-castle of cardboard and scarlet zephyr that
fluttered from the ceiling&mdash;yet in and over and through
the dark of it was a forbidding spirit that breathed out
the cold mustiness of the tomb&mdash;an all-pervading thing
of gloom and majesty which was nothing in itself, yet a
quality and part of everything, even of himself when he
looked in. And this quality or spirit he conceived to be
God&mdash;the more as it came to him in a flash of divination
that the superb and immaculate coal-stove must
be like the Ark of the Covenant.</p>

<p>Thus the Front Room became what &quot;Heaven&quot;
meant to him when he heard the word&mdash;a place
difficult of access, to be prized not so much for
what it actually afforded as for what it enabled
one to avoid; a place whose very joys, indeed,
would fill with dismay any but the absolutely pure
in heart; a place of restricted area, moreover, while
all outside was a speciously pleasant hell, teeming
with every potent solicitation of evil, of games and
sweets and joyous idleness.</p>

<p>The word &quot;God,&quot; then, became at this time a word
of evil import to the littler boy, as sinister as the
rustle of black silk on a Sabbath morning, when
he must walk sedately to church with his hand in
Clytie's, with scarce an envious glance at the proud,
happy loafers, who, clean-shaven and in their own
Sabbath finery, sat on the big boxes in front of the
shut stores and whittled and laughed and gossiped
rarely, like very princes.</p>

<p>To Clytie he once said, of something for which he was
about to ask her permission, &quot;Oh, it must be awful,
<i>awful</i> wicked&mdash;because I want to do it very, very much!
&mdash;not like, going to church.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet the ascetic life was not devoid of compensation&mdash;
particularly when Milo Barrus, the village atheist, was
pointed out to him among the care-free Sabbath loafers.</p>

<p>Clytie predicted most direly interesting things of him
if he did not come to the Feet before he died. &quot;But
I believe he <i>will</i> come to the Feet,&quot; she added, &quot;even if
it's on his very death-bed, with the cold sweat standing
on his brow. It would make a lovely tract&mdash;him
coming to the Feet at the very last moment and his
face lighting up and everything.&quot;</p>

<p>The little boy, however, rather hoped Milo Barrus
wouldn't come to the Feet. It was more worth while
going to Heaven if he didn't, and if you could look
down and see him after it was too late for him to come.
During church that morning he chiefly wondered about
the Feet. Once, long ago, it seemed, he had been with
his dear father in a very big city, and out of the maze
of all its tangled marvels of sound and sight he had
brought and made his own forever one image: the
image of a mighty foot carved in marble, set on a
pedestal at the bottom of a dark stairway. It had been
severed at the ankle, and around the top was modestly
chiselled a border of lace. It was a foot larger than his
whole body, and he had passed eager, questioning hands
over its whole surface, pressing it from heel to each
perfect toe. Of course, this must be one of the Feet
to which Milo Barrus might come; he wondered if the
other would be up that dark stairway, and if Milo
Barrus would go up to look for it&mdash;and what did you
have to do when you got to the Feet? The possibility
of not getting to them, or of finding only one of them,
began to fill his inner life quite as the sombre shadows
filled and made a presence of themselves in the Front
Room&mdash;particularly of a Sabbath, when one must be
uncommonly good because God seemed to take more
notice than on week-days.</p>

<p>During the week, indeed, Clytie often relaxed her
austerity. She would even read to him verses of her
own composition, of which he never tired and of which
he learned to repeat not a few. One of her pastoral
poems told of a visit she had once made to the home
of a relative in a neighbouring State. It began thus:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;New Hampshire is a pretty place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did go there to see<br>
&nbsp;The maple-sugar being boiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By one that's dear to me.&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Bernal came to know it all as far as the stanza&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;I loved to hear the banjo hum,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds so very calmly;<br>
&nbsp;If a happy home you wish to find,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the Thompson family.&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>After this the verses became less direct, and, to his
mind, rather wordy and purposeless, though he never
failed of joy in the mere verbal music of them when
Clytie read, with sometimes a kind of warm tremble
in her voice&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;At lovers' promises fates grow merrilee;<br>
&nbsp;Some are made on land,<br>
&nbsp;Some on the deep sea.<br>
&nbsp;Love does sometimes leave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams of tears.&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>He thought she looked very beautiful when she read
this, in a voice that sounded like crying, with her big,
square face, her fat cheeks that looked like russet
apples, her very tiny black moustache, her smooth, oily
black hair with a semicircle of tight little curls over her
brow, and her beautiful, big, rounded, shining forehead.</p>

<p>Yet he preferred her poems of action, like that of
Salmon Faubel, whose bride became so homesick in
Edom that she was in a way to perish, so that Salmon
took her to her home and found work there for himself.
He even sang one catchy couplet of this to music of his
own:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;For her dear sake whom he did pity,<br>
&nbsp;He took her back to Jersey City.&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>But the Sabbath came inexorably to bring his sinful
nature before him, just as the door of the Front Room
was opened each week to remind him of the awful joys
of Heaven. And then his mind was like the desert of
shifting sands. There were so many things to be done
and not done if one were to avert the wrath of this God
that made the Front Room a cavern of terror, that
rumbled threateningly in the prayer of his grandfather
and shook the young minister to a white passion each
Sabbath.</p>

<p>There was being good&mdash;which was not to commit
murder or be an atheist like Milo Barrus and spell God
with a little g; and there was Coming to the Feet&mdash;not
so simple as it sounded, he could very well tell them;
and there was the matter of Blood. There were
hymns, for example, that left him confused. The &quot;
fountain filled with blood drawn from Immanuel's
veins&quot; sounded interesting. Vividly he saw the
&quot;sinners plunged beneath that flood&quot; losing all their
guilty stains. It was entirely reasonable, and with
an assumption of carelessness he glanced cautiously
over his own body each morning to see if his guilty
stains showed yet. But who was Immanuel? And
where was this excellent fountain?</p>

<p>Then there was being &quot;washed in the blood of the
lamb,&quot; which was considerably simpler&mdash;except for the
matter of its making one &quot;whiter than snow.&quot; He was
doubtful of this result, unless it was only poetry-writing
which doesn't mean everything it says. He meant to
try this sometime, when he could get a lamb, both as a
means of grace and as a desirable experiment.</p>

<p>But plunging into the fountain filled with blood
sounded far more important and effectual&mdash;if it were
only practicable. As the sinners came out of this flood
he thought they must look as Clytie did in her scarlet
flannel petticoat the night he was taken with croup and
she came running with the Magnetic Ointment&mdash;even
redder!</p>

<p>The big white house of Grandfather Delcher and
Clytie, in short, was a house in which to be terrified and
happy; anxious and well-fed. And if its inner recesses
took on too much gloomy portent one could always fly
to the big yard where grew monarch elms and maples
and a row of formal spruces; where the lawn on one side
was bordered with beds of petunias and fuschias, tiger-lilies
and dahlias; where were a great clump of white
lilacs and many bushes of yellow roses; a lawn that
stretched unbrokenly to the windows of the next big
house where lived the gentle stranger with the soft,
warm little voice who had chosen the good name of
Lillian May.</p>

<p>Life was severely earnest but by no means impracticable.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="ChapterVA"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Life of Crime is Appraised and Chosen</h3>

<p>It came to seem expedient to Bernal, however, in the
first spring of his new life, to make a final choice between
early death and a life, of sin. Matters came to press
upon him, and since virtue was useful only to get one
into Heaven, it was not worth the effort unless one
meant to die at once. This was an alternative not
without its lures, despite the warnings preached all
about him. It would surely be interesting to die, if one
had come properly to the Feet. Even coming to but
one of the Feet, as he had, might make it still more
interesting. Perhaps he would not, for this reason, be
always shut up in Heaven. In his secret heart was a
lively desire to see just what they did to Milo Barrus, if
he <i>should</i> continue to spell God with a little g on his
very death-bed&mdash;that is, if he could see it without disadvantage
to himself: But then, you could save that
up, because you <i>must</i> die sometime, like Xerxes the
Great; and meantime, there was the life of evil now
opening wide to the vision with all enticing refreshments.</p>

<p>First, it meant no school. He had ceased to picture
relief in this matter by the school-house burning some
morning, preferably a Monday morning, one second
after school had taken in. For a month he had daily
dramatised to himself the building's swift destruction
amid the kind and merry flames. But Allan, to whom
he had one day hinted the possibility of this gracious
occurrence, had reminded him brutally that they would
probably have school in the Methodist church until a
new school-house could be built. For Allan loved his
school and his teacher.</p>

<p>But a life of evil promised other joys besides this
negative one of no school. In his latest Sunday-school
book, Ralph Overton, the good boy, not only attended
school slavishly, so that at thirteen he &quot;could write a
good business hand&quot;; but he practised those little tricks
of picking up every pin, always untying the string instead
of cutting it, keeping his shoes neatly polished and his
hands clean, which were, in a simpler day, held to lay
the foundations of commercial success in our republic.
Besides this, Ralph had to be bright and cheery to every
one, to work for his widowed mother after school; and
every Saturday afternoon he went, sickeningly of his
own accord, to split wood for an aged and poor lady.
This lady seemed to Bernal to do nothing much but burn
a tremendous lot of stove-wood, but presently she
turned out to be the long-lost cousin of Mr. Granville
Parkinson, the Great Banker from the City, who thereupon
took cheery Ralph there and gave him a position
in the bank where he could be honest and industrious
and respectful to his superiors. Such was the barren
tale of Virtue's gain. But contrasted with Ralph
Overton in this book was one Budd Jackson, who led a
life of voluptuous sloth, except at times when the evil
one moved him to activity. At these bad moments he
might go bobbing for catfish on a Sabbath, or purloin
fruit from the orchard of Farmer Haskins (who would
gladly have given some to him if he had but asked for
it civilly, so the book said); or he might bully smaller
boys whom he met on their way to school, taking their
sailor hats away from them, or jeering coarsely at their
neatly brushed garments. When Budd broke a window
in the Methodist parsonage with his slung-shot and
tried to lie it on to Ralph Overton, he seemed to have
given way utterly to his vicious nature. He was known
soon thereafter to have drunk liquor and played a game
called pin-pool with a &quot;flashy stranger&quot; at the tavern;
hence no one was surprised when he presently ran off
with a circus, became an infidel, and perished miserably
in the toils of vice.</p>

<p>This touch about the circus, well-intended, to be sure,
was yet fatal to all good the tale might have done the
little boy. Clytie, who read most of the story to him,
declared Budd Jackson to be &quot;a regular mean one.&quot;
But in his heart Bernal, thinking all at once of the
circus, sickened unutterably of Virtue. To drive
eight spirited white horses, seated high on one of those
gay closed wagons&mdash;those that went through the street
with that delicious hollow rumble&mdash;hearing perchance
the velvet tread, or the clawing and snarling of some
pent ferocity&mdash;a leopard, a lion, what not; to hear each
day that muffled, flattened beating of a bass drum and
cymbals far within the big tent, quick and still more
quickly, denoting to the experienced ear that pink and
spangled Beauty danced on the big white horse at a
deathless gallop; to know that one might freely enter
that tented elysium&mdash;if it were possible he would run
off with a circus though it meant that he had the
morals of a serpent!</p>

<p>Now, eastward from the big house lay the village
and its churches: thither was tame virtue. But westward
lay a broad field stretching off to an orchard, and
beyond swelled a gentle hill, mellow in the distance.
Still more remotely far, at the hill's rim, was a blur of
woods beyond which the sun went down each night.
This, in the little boy's mind, was the highway to the
glad free Life of Evil. Many days he looked to that
western wood when the sky was a gush of colour
behind its furred edge, perceiving all manner of allurements to
beckon him, hearing them plead, feeling them tug.
Daily his spirit quickened within him to their solicitations,
leaping out and beyond him in some magic way
to bring back veritable meanings and values of the
future.</p>

<p>Then a day came when the desire to be off was no
longer resistible. There was a month of school yet; an
especially bitter thought, for had he not lately been out
of school a week with mumps; and during that very
week had not the teacher's father died, so that he was
cheated out of the resulting three-days' vacation, other
children being free while he lay on a bed of pain&mdash;if
you tasted pickles or any sour thing? Not only was
it useless to try to learn to write &quot;a good business hand,&quot;
like Ralph Overton&mdash;he took the phrase to mean one of
those pictured hands that were always pointing to
things in the newspaper advertisements&mdash;but there
was the circus and other evil things&mdash;and he was getting
on in years.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday afternoon. To-morrow would be
too late. He knew he would not be allowed to start
on the Sabbath, even in a career that was to be all
wickedness. In the grape-arbour he massed certain
articles necessary for the expedition: a very small strip
of carpet on which he meant to sleep; a copy of &quot;<i>Golden
Days</i>,&quot; with an article giving elaborate instructions for
camping in the wilderness. He was compelled to
disregard all of them, but there was comfort and sustenance
in the article itself. Then there was the gun
that came at Christmas. It shot a cork as far as the
string would let it go, with a fairly satisfying report
(he would have that string off, once he was in the
woods!). Also there were three glass alleys, two agate
taws and thirty-eight commies. And to hold his outfit
there was a rather sizable box which he with his own
hands had papered inside and out from a remnant of
gorgeously flowered wall-paper.</p>

<p>When all was ready he went in to break the news to
Clytie. She, busy with her baking, heard him declare:</p>

<p>&quot;Now&mdash;I'm going to leave this place!&quot; with the
look of one who will not be coaxed nor in any manner
dissuaded. He thought she took it rather coolly,
though Allan ran, as promptly as he could have wished,
to tell his grandfather.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to be a regular mean one&mdash;<i>worse'n</i>
Budd Jackson!&quot; he continued to Clytie. He was glad
to see that this brought her to her senses.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you stay if I give you&mdash;an orange?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, <i>sir</i>;&mdash;you'll never set eyes on <i>me</i> again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, now!&mdash;two oranges?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't&mdash;I <i>got</i> to go!&quot; in a voice tense with effort.</p>

<p>&quot;All right! Then I'll give them to Allan.&quot;</p>

<p>She continued to take brown loaves from the oven
and to put other loaves in to bake, while he stood
awkwardly by, loath to part from her. Allan came
back breathless.</p>

<p>&quot;Grandpa says you can go as far as you like and you
needn't come back till you get ready!&quot;</p>

<p>He shifted from one foot to the other and absently ate
a warm cookie from the jarful at his hand. He
thought this seemed not quite the correct attitude to take
toward him, yet he did not waver. They would be
sorry enough in a few days, when it was too late.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I better take a few of these along with me,&quot;
he said, stowing cookies in the pockets of his jacket.
He would have liked one of the big preserved peaches
all punctuated with cloves, but he saw no way to carry
it, and felt really unable to eat it on the spot.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, good-bye!&quot; he called to Clytie, turning back
to her from the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye! Won't you shake hands with me?&quot;</p>

<p>Very solemnly he shook her big, floury hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Now&mdash;could I take Penny along?&quot; (Penny was an
inconsequential dog that had been given to Clytie by one
whom she called Cousin Bill J.)</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you'll need a dog to keep the animals off.
Now be sure you write to us&mdash;at least twice a year&mdash;
don't forget!&quot; And, brutally before his very eyes, she
handed the sniffing and virtuous Allan two of the
largest, most goldenly beautiful oranges ever beheld by
man.</p>

<p>Bitterly the self-exiled turned from this harrowing
scene and strode toward his box.</p>

<p>Here ensued a fresh complication. Nancy, who had
chosen the good name of Lillian May, wanted to go
with him. She, too, it appeared, was fresh from a
Sunday-school book&mdash;one in which a girl of her own age
was so proud of her long raven curls that she was brought
to an illness and all her hair came out. There was a
distressing picture of this little girl after a just Providence
had done its work as a depilatory. And after
she recovered from the fever, it seemed, she had cared to
do nothing but read the Scriptures to bed-ridden old
ladies&mdash;even after a good deal of her hair came in again
&mdash;though it didn't curl this time. The only pleasure she
ever experienced thereafter was that, by virtue of her
now singularly angelic character, she was enabled to
convert an elderly female Papist&mdash;an achievement the
joys of which were problematic, both to Nancy and the
little boy. Certainly, whatever converting a Papist
might be, it was nothing comparable to driving a
red-and-green-and-gold wagon in which was caged the
Scourge of the Jungle.</p>

<p>But Nancy could not go with him. He told her so
plainly. It was no place for a girl beyond that hill
where they commonly drove caged beasts, and no one
ever so much as thought of Coming to the Feet or
washing in the blood of the Lamb, or writing a good
business hand with the first finger of it pointing out, or
anything.</p>

<p>The little girl pleaded, promising to take her new pink
silk parasol, her buff buttoned shoes, a Christmas card
with real snow on it, shining like diamonds, and
Fragile, her best doll. The thing was impossible.
Then she wept.</p>

<p>He whistled to Penny, who came barking joyously&mdash;
a pretender of a dog, if there ever was one&mdash;and they
moved off. Weeping after them went Nancy&mdash;as far
as the first fence, between two boards of which she put
her head and sobbed with a heavenly bitterness; for to
the little boy, pushing sternly on, her tears afforded that
certain thrill of gratified brutality under conscious
rectitude, the capacity for which is among those matters
by which Heaven has set the male of our species apart
from the female. The sensation would have been
flawless but for Allan's lack of dignity: from the top
board of the fence he held aloft in either hand a golden
orange, and he chanted in endless inanity:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>Chink, Chink Chiraddam!<br>
Don't you wisht you had 'em?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chink, Chink Chiraddam!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't you wisht you had 'em?</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Still he was actually and triumphantly off.</p>

<p>And here should be recalled the saying of a certain
wise, simple man: &quot;If our failures are made tragic by
courage they are not different from successes.&quot; For it
came about that the subsequent dignity of this revolt
was to be wholly in its courage.</p>

<p>The way led over a stretch of grassy prairie to a
fence. This surmounted, there came a ploughed field,
of considerable extent to one carrying an inconvenient
box. At the farther end of this was another fence,
and beyond this an ancient orchard with a grassy
floor, where lingered a few old apple-trees, under
which the recumbent cows, chewing and placid, dozed
like stout old ladies over their knitting.</p>

<p>Nearest the fence was an aged, gnarled and riven
tree, foolishly decked in blossoms, like some faded,
wrinkled dame, fatuously reluctant to leave off girlish
finery. Under its frivolous branches on the grassy
sward would be the place for his first night's halt&mdash;for
the magic wood just this side of the sun was now seen
to be farther off than he had once supposed. So he
spread his carpet, arranged the contents of his box
neatly, and ate half his food-supply, for one's strength
must be kept up in these affairs. As he ate he looked
back toward the big house&mdash;now left forever&mdash;and
toward the village beyond. The spires of the three
churches were all pointing sternly upward, as if they
would mutely direct him aright, but in their shelter one
must submit to the prosaic trammels of decency. It
was not to be thought of.</p>

<p>He longed for morning to come, so that he might be
up and on. He lay down on his mat to be ready for
sleep, and watched a big bird far above, cutting lazy
graceful figures in the air, like a fancy skater. Then,
on a bough above him, a little dusty-looking bird
tried to sing, but it sounded only like a very small door
creaking on tiny rusted hinges. A fat, gluttonous robin
that had been hopping about to peer at him, chirped far
more cheerfully as it flew away.</p>

<p>Just at this point he suffered a real adventure. Eight
cows sauntered up interestedly and chewed their cuds
at him in unison, standing contemplative, calculating,
determined. It is a fact in natural history not widely
enough recognised that the domestic cow is the most
ferocious appearing of all known beasts&mdash;a thing to be
proved by any who will survey one amid strange surroundings,
with a mind cleanly disabused of preconceptions.
A visitor from another planet, for example,
knowing nothing of our fauna, and confronted in the
forest simultaneously by a common red milch cow and
the notoriously savage black leopard of the Himalyas,
would instinctively shun the cow as a dangerous beast
and confidingly seek to fondle the pretty leopard, thus
terminating his natural history researches before they
were fairly begun.</p>

<p>It can be understood, then, that a moment ensued
when the little boy wavered under the steady questioning
scrutiny of eight large and powerful cows, all chewing
at him in unison. Yet, even so, and knowing, moreover,
that strange cows are ever untrustworthy, only for
a moment did he waver. Then his new straw hat was
off to be shaken at them and he heaved a fierce
&quot;<i>H-a-y&mdash;y-u-p!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>At this they started, rather indignantly, seeming to
meditate his swift destruction; but another shout
turned and routed them, and he even chased them a
little way, helped now by the inconsiderable dog who
came up from pretending to hunt gophers.</p>

<p>After this there seemed nothing to do but eat the
other half of the provisions and retire again for the
night. Long after the sun went down behind the
magic wood he lay uneasily on his lumpy bed, trying
again and again to shut his eyes and open them to find
it morning&mdash;which was the way it always happened in
the west bedroom of the big house he had left forever.</p>

<p>But it was different here. And presently, when it
seemed nearly dark except for the stars, a disgraceful
thing happened. He had pictured the dog as faithful
always to him, refusing in the end even to be taken from
over his dead body. But the treacherous Penny grew
first restive, then plainly desirous of returning to his
home. At last, after many efforts to corrupt the
adventurer, he started off briskly alone&mdash;cornerwise, as
little dogs seem always to run&mdash;fleeing shamelessly
toward that east where shone the tame lights of Virtue.</p>

<p>Left alone, the little boy began strangely to remember
certain phrases from a tract that Clytie had
tried to teach him&mdash;&quot;the moment that will close thy
life on earth and begin thy song in heaven or thy wail
in hell&quot;&mdash;&quot;impossible to go from the haunts of sin and
vice to the presence of the Lamb&quot;&mdash;&quot;the torments of
an eternal hell are awaiting thee&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;To-night may be thy latest breath, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy little moment here be done.<br>
&nbsp; Eternal woe, the second death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awaits the Christ-rejecting one.&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>This was more than he had ever before been able
to recall of such matters. He wished that he might
have forgotten them wholly. Yet so was he turned
again to better things. Gradually he began to have
an inkling of a possibility that made his blood icy
&mdash;a possibility that not even the spectacle of Milo
Barrus having interesting things done to him could
mitigate&mdash;namely, a vision of himself in the same
plight with that person.</p>

<p>Now it was that he began to hear Them all about
him. They walked stealthily near, passed him with
sinister rustlings, and whispered over him. If
They had only talked out&mdash;but they whispered&mdash;even
laughing, crying and singing in whispers. This
horror, of course, was not long to be endured. Yet,
even so, with increasing myriads of Them all about,
rustling and whispering their awful laughs and cries
&mdash;it was no ignominious rout. With considerable deliberation
he folded the carpet, placed it in the box with his
other treasure, and started at a pace which may, perhaps,
have quickened a little, yet was never undignified
&mdash;never more than a moderately fast trudge.</p>

<p>He wondered sadly if Clytie would get up to unlock
the door for him so late at night. As for Penny, things
could never be the same between them again.</p>

<p>He was astounded to see lights burning and the
house open&mdash;how weird for them to have supper at
such an hour! He concealed his box in the grape-arbour
and slunk through the kitchen into the dining-room.
Probably they had gotten up in the middle of
the night, out of tardy alarm for him. It served them
right. Yet they seemed hardly to notice him when he
slid awkwardly into his chair. He looked calculatingly
over the table and asked, in tones that somehow seemed
to tell of injury, of personal affront:</p>

<p>&quot;What you having supper for at this time of night?&quot;</p>

<p>His grandfather regarded him now not unkindly,
while Clytie seemed confused.</p>

<p>&quot;It's more'n long past midnight!&quot; he insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh! it ain't only a quarter past seven,&quot; put in his
superior brother. He seemed about to say more, but
a glance from the grandfather silenced him.</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was as late as he had stayed&mdash;a quarter after
seven? He was ready now to rage at any taunt, and
began to eat in haughty silence. He was still eating
when his grandfather and Allan left the table, and
then he began to feel a little grateful that they had not
noticed or asked annoying questions, or tried to be
funny or anything. Over a final dish of plum preserves
and an imposing segment of marble cake he
relented so far as to tell Clytie something of his adventures
&mdash;especially since she had said that the big
hall-clock was very likely slow&mdash;that it must surely be
a lot later than a quarter past seven. The circumstances
had combined to produce a narrative not
entirely perspicuous&mdash;the two clear points being that
They do everything in a whisper, and that Clytie ought
to get rid of Penny at once, since he could not be
depended upon at great moments.</p>

<p>As to ever sleeping under a tree, Clytie discouraged
him. She knew of some Boys that once sat under a
tree which was struck by lightning, all being killed save
one, who had the rare good luck to be the son of a
Presbyterian clergyman. The little boy resolved next
time to go beyond the trees to sleep; perhaps if he went
far enough he would come to the other one of the Feet,
and so have a safeguard against lightning, foreign cows,
and Those that walk with rustlings and whisper in the
lonely places at night.</p>

<p>The little boy fell asleep, half-persuaded again to
virtue, because of its superior comforts. The air about
his head seemed full of ghostly &quot;good business hands,&quot;
each with its accusing forefinger pointed at him for
that he had not learned to write one as Ralph Overton
did.</p>

<p>Down the hall in his study the old man was musing
backward to the delicate, quiet girl with the old-fashioned
aureole of curls, who would now and then
toss them with a little gesture eloquent of possibilities
for unrestraint when she felt the close-drawn rein of
his authority. Again he felt her rebellious little tugs,
and the wrench of her final defiance when she did the
awful thing. He had been told by a plain speaker that
her revolt was the fault of his severity. And here was
the flesh of her flesh&mdash;was it in the same spirit of revolt
against authority, a thousandfold magnified? Might
he not by according the boy a wise liberty save him in
after years from some mad folly akin to his mother's?</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Garden of Truth and the Perfect Father</h3>

<p>It was a different summer from those that had gone
before it.</p>

<p>A little passionate Protestant had sallied out to
make bed with the gods; and the souls of such the
just gods do truly take into certain shining realms
whither poor involatile bodies of flesh may not follow.
The requirement is that one feel his own potential
godship enough to rebel. For, having rebelled, he will
assuredly venture beyond mortal domains into that
garden where stands the tree of Truth&mdash;this garden
being that one to the west just beyond the second fence
(or whichever fence); that point where the mortal of
invertebrate soul is beset with the feeling that he has
already dared too far&mdash;that he had better make for
home mighty quick if he doesn't want Something to
get him. The essence of this decision is quite the same
whether the mortal be eight years old or eighty. Now
the Tree of Truth stands just over this line at which
all but the gods' own turn to scamper back before
supper. It is the first tree to the left&mdash;an apple-tree,
twisted, blackened, scathed, eaten with age, yet full
of blossoms as fresh and fertile as those first born of
any young tree whatsoever. Those able rightly to read
this tree of Truth become at once as the gods, keeping
the faith of children while absorbing the wisdom of the
ages&mdash;lacking either of which, be it known, one may
not become an imperishable ornament of Time.</p>

<p>But to him who is bravely faithful to the passing of
that last fence, who reclines under that tree even for
so long as one aspiration, comes a substantial gain:
ever after, when he goes into any solitude, he becomes
more than himself. Then he reads the first lesson of
the tree of Truth, which is that the spirit of Life ages
yet is ageless; and suffers yet is joyous. This is no
inconsiderable reward for passing that frontier, even
if one must live longer to comprehend reasons. It is
worth while even if the mortal become a mere dilettante
in paradoxes and never learn even feebly to spell the
third lesson, which is the ultimate wisdom of the gods.</p>

<p>These matters being precisely so, the little boy knew
quite as well as the gods could know it, that a credit had
been set down to his soul for what he had ventured&mdash;
even though what he had not done was, so far, more
stupendous than what he had, in the world of things and
mere people. He now became enamoured of life rather
than death; and he studied the Shorter Catechism with
such effect that he could say it clear over to &quot;<i>Every sin
deserveth God's wrath and curse both in this life and
that which is to come.</i>&quot; Each night he tried earnestly
to learn two new answers; and glad was he when his
grandfather would sit by him, for the old man had now
become his image of God, and it seemed fitting to
recite to him. Often as they sat together the little
boy would absently slip his hand into the big, warm,
bony hand of the old man, turning and twisting it there
until he felt an answering pressure. This embarrassed
the old man. Though he would really have
liked to take the little boy up to his breast and hold him
there, he knew not how; and he would even be careful
not to restrain the little hand in his own&mdash;to hold it,
yet to leave it free to withdraw at its first uneasy wriggle.</p>

<p>Of this shackled spirit of kindness, always striving
within the old man, the little boy had come to be
entirely conscious. So real was it to him, so dependable,
that he never suspected that a certain little blow with
the open hand one day was meant to punish him for
conduct he had persisted in after three emphatic
admonitions.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! that <i>hurts</i>!&quot; he had cried, looking up at the
confused old man with unimpaired faith in his having
meant not more than a piece of friendly roughness.
This look of flawless confidence in the uprightness of
his purpose, the fine determination to save him chagrin
by smiling even though the hurt place tingled, left in
the old man's mind a biting conviction that he had been
actually on the point of behaving as one gentleman
may not behave to another. Quick was he to make
the encounter accord with the child's happy view, even
picking him up and forcing from himself the gaiety to
rally him upon his babyish tenderness to rough play.
Not less did he hold it true that &quot;The rod and reproof
give wisdom, but a child left to himself bringeth his
mother to shame&mdash;&mdash;&quot; and with the older boy he was
not unconscientious in this matter. For Allan took
punishment as any boy would, and, indeed, was so
careful that he seldom deserved it. But the old man
never ceased to be grateful that the littler boy had
laughed under that one blow, unable to suspect that
it could have been meant in earnest.</p>

<p>From the first day that the little boy felt the tender
cool grass under his bare toes that summer, life became
like perfectly played music. This was after the long
vacation began, when there was no longer any need to
remember to let his voice fall after a period, or to dread
his lessons so that he must learn them more quickly than
any other pupil in school. There would be no more
of that wretched fooling until fall, a point of time
inconceivably far away. Before it arrived any one of
a number of strange things might happen to avert the
calamity of education. For instance, he might be born
again, a thing of which he had lately heard talk; a contingency
by no means flawless in prospect, since it probably
meant having the mumps again, and things like that.
But if it came on the very last day of vacation, or on the
first morning of school, just as he was called on to
recite, snatching him from the very jaws of the Moloch,
and if it fixed him so he need not be afraid in the night
of going where Milo Barrus was going, then it might not
be so bad.</p>

<p>Nancy, who had now discarded the good name of
Lillian May for simple Alice, disapproved heartily of
being born again; unless, indeed, one could be born a
boy the second time. She was only too eager for the
day when she need not submit to having her hair
brushed and combed so long every morning of her life.
Not for the world would she go through it again and
have to begin French all over, even at &quot;<i>J'ai, tu as, il
a</i>.&quot; Yet, if it were certain she could be a boy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was too considerate to tell her that this was as
good as impossible&mdash;that she quite lacked the qualities
necessary for that. Instead, he reassured her with the
chivalrous fiction that he, at least, would like her as
well as if she <i>were</i> a boy. And, indeed, as a girl, she
was not wholly unsatisfactory. True, she played
&quot;school&quot; (of all things!) in preference to &quot;wild animals,&quot;
practised scales on the piano an hour every day, wore
a sun-hat frequently&mdash;spite of which she was freckled&mdash;
wore shoes and stockings on the hottest days, when
one's feet are so hungry for the cool, springy turf, and
performed other acts repugnant to a soul that has
brought itself erect. But she was fresh and dainty to
look at, like an opened morning glory, with pretty
frocks that the French lady whose name was Madmasel
made her wear every day, and her eyes were much like
certain flowers in the bed under the bay-window, with
very long, black lashes that got all stuck together when
she cried; and she made superb capital letters, far better
than the little boy's, though she was a year younger.</p>

<p>Also, which was perhaps her chief charm, she could
be made to believe that only he could protect her from
the Gratcher, a monstrous thing, half beast, half human,
which was often seen back of the house; sometimes
flitting through the grape-arbour, sometimes coming
out of the dark cellar, sometimes peering around corners.
It was a thing that went on enormous crutches, yet
could always catch you if it saw you by daylight out of
its right eye, its left being serviceable only at night, when,
if you were wise, you kept in the house. Once the
Gratcher saw you with its right eye the crutches swung
toward you and you were caught: it picked you up and
began to look you all over, with the eyes in the ends of
its fingers. This tickled you so that you went crazy in
a minute.</p>

<p>Nancy feared the Gratcher, and she became supremely
lovely to the little boy when she permitted him
to guard her from it, instead of running home across
the lawn when it was surely coming;&mdash;a loveliness he
felt more poignantly at certain reflective times when
he was not also afraid. For, the Gratcher being his own
invention, these moments of superiority to its terrors
would inevitably seize him.</p>

<a name="gratcher"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="images/gratcher.jpg"><img src="images/gratcher.jpg"
alt="" width="600" border="0"></a><br>
&quot;She could be made to believe that only he could protect her from the Gratcher.&quot;
</div>

<p>Better than protecting Nancy did he love to report
the Gratcher's immediate presence to Allan, daring him
to stay on that spot until it put its dreadful head around
the corner and shook one of its crutches at them. In
low throbbing tones he would report its fearful approach,
stride by stride, on the crutches. This he
could do by means of the Gratcher-eye, with which he
claimed to be endowed. One having a Gratcher-eye
can see around any corner when a Gratcher happens
to be coming&mdash;yet only then, not at any other time, as
Allan had proved by experiment on the first disclosure
of this phenomenon. He of the Gratcher-eye could
positively not see around a corner, if, for example,
Allan himself was there; the Gratcher-eye could not
tell if his hat was on his head or off. But this by no
means proved that the Gratcher-eye did not exercise
its magic function when a Gratcher actually approached,
and Allan knew it. He would stand staunchly, with a
fine incredulity, while the little boy called off the
strides, perhaps, until he announced &quot;<i>Now</i> he's just
passed the well-curb&mdash;<i>now</i> he's&mdash;&mdash;&quot; but here, scoffing
over an anxious shoulder, Allan would go in where
Clytie was baking, feigning a sudden great hunger.</p>

<p>Nancy would stay, because she believed the little
boy's protestations that he could save her, and the
little boy himself often believed them.</p>

<p>&quot;I love Allan best, because he is so comfortable, but
I think you are the most admirable,&quot; she would say to
him at such times; and he thought well of her if she
had seemed very, very frightened.</p>

<p>So life had become a hardy sport with him. No
longer was he moved to wish for early dissolution when
Clytie's song floated to him:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;'I should like to die,' said Willie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If my papa could die, too;<br>
&nbsp;But he says he isn't ready,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Cause he has so much to do!&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>This Willie had once seemed sweet and noble to him,
but the words now made him avid of new life by reminding
him that his own dear father would soon come
to be with him one week, as he had promised when last
they parted, and as a letter written with magnificent
flourishes now announced.</p>

<p>Late in August this perfect father came&mdash;a fine
laughing, rollicking, big gentleman, with a great, loud
voice, and beautiful long curls that touched his velvet
coat-collar. His sweeping golden moustache, wide-brimmed
white hat, the choice rings on his fingers, his
magnificently ponderous gold watch-chain and a watch
of the finest silver, all proclaimed him a being of such
flawless elegance both in person and attire that the
little boy never grew tired of showing him to the village
people and to Clytie. He did not stay at the big house,
for some reason, but at the Eagle Hotel, whence he
came to see his boys each day, or met them hurrying to
see him. And for a further reason which the little
boys did not understand, their grandfather continued
to be too busy to see this perfect father once during the
week he stayed in the village.</p>

<p>Deeming it a pity that two such choice spirits should
not be brought together, the little boy urged his father
to bring his fiddle to the big house and play and sing
some of his fine songs, so that his grandfather could
have a chance to hear some good music. He knew
well enough that if the old man once heard this music
he would have to give in and enjoy it, even if he was too
busy to come down. And if only his father would tune
up the fiddle and sing that very, very good song about,</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;The more she said 'Whoa!'<br>
&nbsp; They cried, 'Let her go!'<br>
&nbsp; And the swing went a little bit higher,&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>if only his grandfather could hear this, one of the
funniest and noisiest songs in the world, perhaps he
would come right down stairs. But his father laughed
away the suggestion, saying that the old gentleman had
no ear for music; which, of course, was a joke, for he
had two, like any person.</p>

<p>Clytemnestra, too, was at first strangely cool to the
incomparable father, though at last she proved not
wholly insensible to his charm, providing for his
refection her very choicest cake and the last tumbler
of crab-apple jelly. She began to suspect that a man
of manners so engaging must have good in him, and
she gave him at parting the tracts of &quot;The Dying
Drummer Boy&quot; and &quot;Sinner, what if You Die To-day?&quot;
for which he professed warm gratitude.</p>

<p>The little boy afterward saw his perfect father hand
these very tracts to Milo Barrus, when they met him
on the street, saying, &quot;Here, Barrus, get your soul
saved while you wait!&quot; Then they laughed together.</p>

<p>The little boy wondered if this meant that Milo
Barrus had come to the Feet, or been born again, or
something. Or if it meant that his father also spelled
God with a little g. He did not think of it, however,
until it was too late to ask.</p>

<p>The flawless father went away at the end of the
week, &quot;over the County Fair circuit, selling Chief
White Cloud's Great Indian Remedy,&quot; the little boy
heard him tell Clytie. Also he heard his grandfather
say to Clytie, &quot;Thank God, not for another year!&quot;</p>

<p>The little boy liked Nancy better than ever after
that, because she had liked his father so much, saying
he was exactly like a prince, giving pennies and nickels
to everybody and being so handsome and big and
grand. She wished her own Uncle Doctor could be as
beautiful and great; and the little boy was generous
enough to wish that his own plain grandfather might
be <i>almost</i> as fine.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Superlative Cousin Bill J.</h3>

<p>A splendid new interest had now come into the
household in the person of one whom Clytemnestra had
so often named as Cousin Bill J. Grandfather Delcher
having been ordered south for the winter by Dr.
Crealock, Cousin Bill J., upon Clytie's recommendation,
was imported from up Fredonia way to look after
the cow and be a man about the place. Clytie assured
Grandfather Delcher that Cousin Bill J. had &quot;never
uttered an oath, though he's been around horses all
his life!&quot; This made him at once an object of interest
to the little boy, though doubtless he failed to appraise
the restraint at anything like its true value. It had
sufficed Grandfather Delcher, however, and Cousin
Bill J., securing leave of absence from the livery-stable
in Fredonia, arrived the day the old man left, making
a double excitement for the household.</p>

<p>He proved to be a fascinating person; handsome,
affable, a ready talker upon all matters of interest&mdash;
though sarcastic, withal&mdash;and fond of boys. True, he
had not long hair like the little boy's father. Indeed,
he had not much hair at all, except a sort of curtain of
black curls extending from ear to ear at the back of his
bare, pink head. But the little boy had to admit that
Cousin Bill J.'s moustache was even grander than his
father's. It fell in two graceful festoons far below his
chin, with a little eyelet curled into each tip, and, like
the ringlets, it showed the blue-black lustre of the
crow's wing. In the full sunlight, at times, it became
almost a royal purple.</p>

<p>Later observation taught the little boy that this
splendid hue was applied at intervals by Cousin Bill J.
himself. He did it daintily with a small brush, every
time the moustache began to show a bit rusty at the
roots; Bernal never failed to be present at this ceremony;
nor to resolve that his own moustache, when it
came, should be as scrupulously cared for&mdash;not left,
like Dr. Crealock's, for example, to become speckled
and gray.</p>

<p>Cousin Bill J.'s garments were as splendid as his
character. He had an overcoat and cap made from a
buffalo hide; his high-heeled boots had maroon tops
set with purple crescents; his watch-charm was a large
gold horse in full gallop; his cravat was an extensive
area of scarlet satin in the midst of which was caught
a precious stone as large as a robin's egg; and in
smoking, which his physician had prescribed, he used a
superb meerschaum cigar-holder, all tinted a golden
brown, upon which lightly perched a carven angel
dressed like those that ride the big white horse in the
circus.</p>

<p>But aside from these mere matters of form, Cousin
Bill J. was a man with a history. Some years before he
had sprained his back, since which time he had been
unable to perform hard labour; but prior to that mishap
he had been a perfect specimen of physical manhood&mdash;
one whose prowess had been the marvel of an extensive
territory. He had split and laid up his three hundred
and fifty rails many a day, when strong men beside him
had blushingly to stop with three hundred or thereabouts;
he had also cradled his four acres of grain in a
day, and he could break the wildest horse ever known.
Even the great Budd Doble, whom he personally knew,
had said more than once, and in the presence of unimpeachable
witnesses, that in some ways he, Budd Doble,
knew less about a horse than Cousin Bill J. did.
The little boy was wrought to enthusiasm by this tribute,
resolving always to remember to say &quot;hoss&quot; for
horse; and, though he had not heard of Budd Doble
before, the name was magnetic for him. After you
said it over several times he thought it made you
feel as if you had a cold in your head.</p>

<p>Still further, Cousin Bill J. could throw his thumbs
out of joint, sing tenor in the choir, charm away warts,
recite &quot;Roger and I&quot; and &quot;The Death of Little Nell,&quot;
and he knew all the things that would make boys grow
fast, like bringing in wood, splitting kindling, putting
down hay for the cow, and other out-of-door exercises
that had made him the demon of strength he once was.
The little boy was not only glad to perform these acts
for his own sake, but for the sake of lightening the
labours of his hero, who wrenched his back anew
nearly every time he tried to do anything, and was
always having to take a medicine for it which he called &quot;peach-and-honey.&quot;
The little boy thought the name attractive,
though his heart bled for the sufferer each time
he was obliged to take it; for after every swallow of the
stuff he made a face that told eloquently how nauseous
it must be.</p>

<p>As for the satire and wit of Cousin Bill J., they were
of the dry sort. He would say to one he met on the
street when the mud was deep, &quot;Fine weather overhead&quot;&mdash;
then adding dryly, after a significant pause&mdash;
&quot;<i>but few going that way!</i>&quot; Or he would exclaim with
feigned admiration, when the little boy shot at a bird
with his bow and arrow, &quot;My! you made the feathers
fly <i>that</i> time!&quot;&mdash;then, after his terrible pause&mdash;<i>&quot;only,
the bird flew with them</i>.&quot; Also he could call it
&quot;Fourth of Ju-New-Years&quot; without ever cracking a
smile, though it cramped the little boy in helpless
laughter.</p>

<p>Altogether, Cousin Bill J. was a winning and lovely
character of merits both spiritual and spectacular, and
he brought to the big house an exotic atmosphere that
was spicy with delights. The little boy prayed that this
hero might be made again the man he once was; not
because of any flaw that he could see in him&mdash;but only
because the sufferer appeared somewhat less than
perfect to himself. To Bernal's mind, indeed, nothing
could have been superior to the noble melancholy with
which Cousin Bill J. looked back upon his splendid
past. There was a perfect dignity in it. Surely no
mere electric belt could bring to him an attraction
surpassing this&mdash;though Cousin Bill J. insisted that he
never expected any real improvement until he could save
up enough money to buy one. He showed the little
boy a picture cut from a newspaper&mdash;the picture of a
strong, proud-looking man with plenteous black
whiskers, girded about with a wide belt that was projecting
a great volume of electricity into the air in
every direction. It was interesting enough, but the
little boy thought this person by no means so beautiful
as Cousin Bill J., and said so. He believed, too, though
this he did not say, from tactful motives, that it would
detract from the dignity of Cousin Bill J. to go about
clad only in an electric belt, like the proud-looking
gentleman in the picture&mdash;even if the belt did send out
a lot of electric wiggles all the time. But, of course,
Cousin Bill J. knew best. He looked forward to
having his father meet this new hero&mdash;feeling that each
was perfect in his own way.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Searching the Scriptures</h3>

<p>Around the evening lamp that winter the little boys
studied Holy Writ, while Allan made summaries of it
for the edification of the proud grandfather in far-off
Florida.</p>

<p>Tersely was the creation and the fall of man set forth,
under promptings and suggestions from Clytie and
Cousin Bill J., who was no mean Bible authority: how
God, &quot;walking in the garden in the cool of the day,&quot;
found his first pair ashamed of their nakedness, and
with his own hands made them coats of skins and
clothed them. &quot;What a treasure those garments would
be in this evil day,&quot; said Clytie&mdash;&quot;what a silencing
rebuke to all heretics!&quot; But the Lord drove out the
wicked pair, lest they &quot;take also of the tree of life and
live forever,&quot; saying, &quot;Behold, the man is become as
one of <i>us!</i>&quot; This provoked a lengthy discussion the
very first evening as to whether it meant that there was
more than one God. And Clytie's view&mdash;that God
called himself &quot;Us&quot; in the same sense that kings and
editors of newspapers do&mdash;at length prevailed over the
polytheistic hypothesis of Cousin Bill J.</p>

<p>On they read to the Deluge, when man became so
very bad indeed that God was sorry for ever having
made him, and said: &quot;I will destroy man whom I have
created from the face of the earth; both man and the
beast and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air,
for it repenteth me that I have made them.&quot;</p>

<p>Hereupon Bernal suggested that all the white
rabbits at least should have been saved&mdash;thinking of
his own two in the warm nest in the barn. He was
unable to see how white rabbits with twitching pink
noses and pink rims around their eyes could be an
offense, or, indeed, other than a pure joy even to one
so good as God. But he gave in, with new admiration
for the ready mind of Cousin Bill J., who pointed out
that white rabbits could not have been saved because
they were not fish. He even relished the dry quip that
maybe he, the little boy, thought white rabbits <i>were</i> fish;
but Cousin Bill J. didn't, for his part.</p>

<p>Past the Tower of Babel they went, when the Lord
&quot;came down to see the city and the tower,&quot; and made
them suddenly talk strange tongues to one another so
they could not build their tower actually into Heaven.</p>

<p>The little boy thought this a fine joke to play on
them, to set them all &quot;jabbering&quot; so.</p>

<p>After that there was a great deal of fighting, and, in
the language of Allan's summary, &quot;God loved all the
good people so he gave them lots of wives and cattle
and sheep and he let them go out and kill all the other
people they wanted to which was their enemies.&quot; But
the little boy found the butcheries rather monotonous.</p>

<p>Occasionally there was something graphic enough to
excite, as where the heads of Ahab's seventy children
were put into a basket and exposed in two heaps at the
city's gate; but for the most part it made him sleepy.</p>

<p>True, when it came to getting the Children of Israel
out of Egypt, as Cousin Bill J. observed, &quot;Things
brisked up considerable.&quot;</p>

<p>The plan of first hardening Pharaoh's heart, then
scaring him by a pestilence, then again hardening his
heart for another calamity, quite won the little boy's
admiration for its ingenuity, and even Cousin Bill J.
would at times betray that he was impressed. Feverishly
they followed the miracles done to Egypt; the
plague of frogs, of lice, of flies, of boils and blains on
man and beast; the plague of hail and lightning, of
locusts, and the three days of darkness. Then came
the Lord's final triumph, which was to kill all the first-born
in the land of Egypt, &quot;from the first-born of
Pharaoh, that sitteth upon the throne, even unto the
first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill;
and all the first-born of beasts.&quot; Again the little boy's
heart ached as he thought pityingly of the first-born of
all white rabbits, but there was too much of excitement
to dwell long upon that humble tragedy. There was
the manner in which the Israelites identified themselves,
by marking their doors with a sprig of hyssop dipped in
the blood of a male lamb without blemish. Vividly did
he see the good God gliding cautiously from door to
door, looking for the mark of blood, and passing the
lucky doors where it was seen to be truly of a male lamb
without blemish. He thought it must have taken a lot
of lambs to mark up all the doors!</p>

<p>Then came that master-stroke of enterprise, when
God directed Moses to &quot;speak now in the ears of the
people and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and
every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and
jewels of gold,&quot; so that they might &quot;spoil&quot; the Egyptians.
Cousin Bill J. chuckled when he read this,
declaring it to be &quot;a regular Jew trick&quot;; but Clytie
rebuked him quickly, reminding him that they were
God's own words, spoken in His own holy voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it was mighty thoughtful in God,&quot; insisted
Cousin Bill J., but Clytie said, however that was, it
served Pharaoh right for getting his heart hardened so
often.</p>

<p>The little boy, not perceiving the exact significance
of &quot;spoil&quot; in this connection, wondered if Cousin Bill J.
would spoil if some one borrowed his gold horse and
ran off with it.</p>

<p>Then came that exciting day when the Lord said, &quot;I
will get me honour upon Pharaoh and all his host,&quot;
which He did by drowning them thoroughly in the Red
Sea. The little boy thought he would have liked to
be there in a boat&mdash;a good safe boat that would not tip
over; also that he would much like to have a rod such
as Aaron had, that would turn into a serpent. It
would be a fine thing to take to school some morning.
But Cousin Bill J. thought it doubtful if one could be
procured; though he had seen Heller pour five colours
of wine out of a bottle which, when broken, proved to
have a live guinea-pig in it. This seemed to the little
boy more wonderful than Aaron's rod, though he felt
it would not reflect honour upon God to say so.</p>

<p>Another evening they spent before Sinai, Cousin
Bill J. reading the verses in a severe and loud tone when
the voice of the Lord was sounding. Duly impressed
was the little boy with the terrors of the divine presence,
a thing so awful that the people must not go up into
the mount nor even touch its border&mdash;lest &quot;the Lord
break forth upon them: There shall not a hand touch
it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether
it be beast or man it shall not live.&quot; Clytie said the
goodness of God was shown herein. An evil God
would not have warned them, and many worthy but
ignorant people would have been blasted.</p>

<p>Then He came down in thunder and smoke and
lightning and earthquakes&mdash;which Cousin Bill J. read
in tones that enabled Bernal to feel every possible joy
of terror; came to tell them that He was a very jealous
God and that they must not worship any of the other
gods. He commanded that &quot;thou shalt not revile the
Gods,&quot; also that they should &quot;make no mention of the
names of other Gods,&quot; which Cousin Bill J. said was
as fair as you could ask.</p>

<p>When they reached the directions for sacrificing, the
little boy was doubly alert&mdash;in the event that he should
ever determine to be washed in the blood of the lamb
and have to do his own killing.</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; read Cousin Bill J., in a voice meant to
convey the augustness of Deity, &quot;thou shalt kill the
ram and take of his blood and put it upon the tip of the
right ear of Aaron and upon the tip of the right ear of
his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and
upon the great toe of their right foot.&quot; So you didn't
have to wash all over in the blood. He agreed with
Clytie, who remarked that no one could ever have
found out how to do it right unless God had told. The
God-given directions that ensued for making the water
of separation from &quot;the ashes of a red heifer&quot; he did not
find edifying; but some verses after that seemed more
practicable. &quot;And thou shalt take of the ram,&quot; continued
the reader in majestic cadence, &quot;the fat and the
rump and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the
caul above the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat
that is upon them&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Here was detail with a satisfying minuteness; and
all this was for &quot;a wave-offering&quot; to be waved before
the Lord&mdash;which was indeed an interesting thought.</p>

<p>&quot;If God was so careful of His children in these small
matters,&quot; said Clytie; &quot;no wonder they believed He
would care for them in graver matters, and no wonder
they looked forward so eagerly to the coming of His Son,
whom He promised should be sent to save them from
His wrath.&quot;</p>

<p>Through God's succeeding minute directions for the
building and upholstery of His tabernacle, &quot;with ten
curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and
scarlet, with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou
make them,&quot; the interest of the little boys rather
languished; likewise through His regulations about such
dry matters as slavery, divorce, and polygamy. His
directions for killing witches and for stoning the ox that
gores a man or woman had more of colour in them.
But there was no real interest until the good God
promised His children to bring them in unto the
Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the
Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, to &quot;cut them
off.&quot; It was not uninteresting to know that God put
Moses in a cleft of the rock and covered it with His
hand when He passed by, thus permitting Moses a
partial view of the divine person. But the actual fighting
of battles was thereafter the chief source of
interest. For God was a mighty God of battles, never weary of
the glories of slaughter. When it was plain that He
could make a handful of two thousand Israelites slay
two hundred thousand Midianites, in a moment, as one
might say, the wisdom of coming to the Feet, being
born again, and washing in the blood ceased to be
debatable. It would seem very silly, indeed, to
neglect any precaution that would insure the favour of
this God, who slew cities full of men and women and
little children off-hand. The little boy thought Milo
Barrus would begin to spell a certain word with the
very biggest &quot;G&quot; he could make, if any one were to
bring these matters to his notice.</p>

<p>As to Allan, who made abstracts of the winter's
study, Clytemnestra and her transcendent relative
agreed that he would one day be a power in the land.
Off to Florida each week they sent his writing to
Grandfather Delcher, who was proud of it, in spite of
his heart going out chiefly to the littler boy.</p>

<p>&quot;So this is all I know now about God,&quot; ran the conclusion,
&quot;except that He loved us so that He gave His
only Son to be crucified so that He could forgive our
sins as soon as He saw His Son nailed up on the cross,
and those that believed it could be with the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, and those that didn't believe it,
like the Jews and heathens, would have to be in hell
for ever and ever Amen. This proves His great love
for us and that He is the true God. So this is
all I have learned this winter about God, who is
a spirit infinite eternal and unchangeable in his being,
wisdom and power holiness justice goodness and truth,
and the word of God is contained in the scriptures of
the old and new testament which is the only rule to
direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him. In my
next I will take up the meek and lowly Jesus and show
you how much I have learned about him.&quot;</p>
<p>They had been unable to persuade the littler boy
into this species of composition, his mind dwelling too
much on the first-born of white rabbits and such, but
to show that his winter was not wholly lost, he submitted
a secular composition, which ran:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>&quot;B<font size="-1">IRDS</font></p>
</div>
<p>&quot;The Animl kindom is devided into birds and
reguler animls. Our teacher says we had ougt to
obsurv so I obsurv there is three kinds of birds Jingle
birds Squeek birds and Clatter birds. Jingle birds has
fat rusty stumacks. I have not the trouble to obsurv
any more kinds.&quot;</p>

<a href="#Toc">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">On Surviving the Idols We Build</h3>

<p>It is the way of life to be forever building new idols
in place of the old. Into the fabric of these the most
of us put so much of ourselves that a little of us dies
each time a cherished image crumbles from age or is
shattered by some lightning-stroke of truth from a cloud
electric with doubt. This is why we fade and wither
as the leaf. Could we but sweep aside the wreck without
dismay and raise a new idol from the overflowing
certainty of youth, then indeed should we have eaten
from that other tree in Eden, for the defence of which is
set the angel with the flaming sword. But this may
not be. Fatuously we stake our souls on each new
creation&mdash;deeming that <i>here</i>, in sooth, is one that shall
endure beyond the end of time. To the last we are
dull to the truth that our idols are meant to be broken,
to give way to other idols still to be broken.</p>

<p>And so we lose a little of ourselves each time an
idol falls; and, learning thus to doubt, wistfully,
stoically we learn to die, leaving some last idol triumphantly
surviving us. For&mdash;and this is the third
lesson from that tree of Truth&mdash;we learn to doubt, not
the perfection of our idols, but the divinity of their
creator. And it would seem that this is quite as it
should be. So long as the idol-maker will be a slave to
his creatures, so long should the idol survive and the
maker go back to useful dust. Whereas, did he doubt
his idols and never himself&mdash;but this is mostly a secret,
for not many common idolmongers will cross that last
fence to the west, beyond the second field, where the
cattle are strange and the hour so late that one must
turn back for bed and supper.</p>

<p>To one who accepts the simple truth thus put down
precisely, it will be apparent that the little boy was
destined to see more than one idol blasted before his
eyes; yet, also, that he was not come to the foolish
caution of the wise, whom failure leads to doubt their
own powers&mdash;as if we were not meant to fail in our
idols forever! Being, then, not come to this spiritual
decrepitude, fitted still to exercise a blessed contempt for
the Wisdom of the Ages, it is plain that he could as yet
see an idol go to bits without dismay, conscious only
of the need for a new and a better one.</p>

<p>Not all one's idols are shattered in a day. This
were a catastrophe that might wrench even youth's divine
credulity.</p>

<p>Not until another year had gone, with its heavy-gaited
school-months and its galloping vacation-days,
did the little boy come to understand that Santa Claus
was not a real presence. And instead of wailing over
the ruins of this idol, he brought a sturdy faith to
bear, building in its place something unseen and unheard
of any save himself&mdash;an idol discernible only
by him, but none the less real for that.</p>

<p>The Imp with the hammer being no respecter of
dignities, the idol of the Front Room fell next, increasing
the heap of ruins that was gathering about his feet.
Tragically came a day one spring, a cold, cloudy,
rational day, it seemed, when the Front Room went
down; for the little boy saw all its sanctities violated,
its mysteries laid bare. And the Front Room became
a mere front room. Its shutters were opened and its
windows raised to let in light and common fresh air;
its carpet was on the line outside to be scourged of dust;
the black, formidable furniture was out on the wide
porch to be re-varnished, like any common furniture,
plainly needing it; the vases of dyed grass might be
handled without risk; and the dark spirit that had
seemed to be in and over all was vanished. Even the
majestic Ark of the Covenant, which the sinful Uzza
once died for so much as touching reverently, was now
seen to be an ordinary stove for the burning of anthracite
coal, to be rattled profanely and polished for an extra
quarter by Sherman Tranquillity Tyler after he had
finished whitewashing the cellar. Fearlessly the little
boy, grown somewhat bigger now, walked among the
d&eacute;bris of this idol, stamping the floor, sounding the
walls, detecting cracks in the ceiling, spots on the wall-paper
and cobwebs in the corners. Yet serene amid
the ruins towered his valiant spirit, conscious under
the catastrophe of its power to build other and yet
stauncher idols.</p>

<p>Thus was it one day to stretch itself with new power
amid the base ruins of Cousin Bill J., though the time
was mercifully deferred&mdash;that his soul might gain
strength in worship to put away even that which it
worshipped when the day of new truth dawned.</p>

<p>When Cousin Bill J., in the waning of that first
winter, began actually to refine his own superlative
elegance by spraying his superior garments with perfume,
by munching tiny confections reputed to scent
the breath desirably, by a more diligent grooming of
the always superb moustache, the little boy suspected
no motive. He saw these works only as the outward
signs of an inward grace that must be ever increasing.
So it came that his amazement was above that of all
other persons when, at Spring's first breath of honeyed
fragrance, Cousin Bill J. went to be the husband of
Miss Alvira Abney. He had not failed to observe that
Miss Alvira sang alto, in the choir, out of the same
book from which Cousin Bill J. produced his exquisite
tenor. But he had reasoned nothing from this, beyond,
perhaps, the thought that Miss Alvira made a poor
figure beside her magnificent companion, even if her
bonnet was always the gayest bonnet in church, trembling
through every season with the blossoms of some
ageless springtime. For the rest, Miss Alvira's face
and hair and eyes seemed to be all one colour, very pale,
and her hands were long and thin, with far too many
bones in them for human hands, the little boy thought.</p>

<p>Yet when he learned that the woman was not without
merit in the sight of his clear-eyed hero, he, too, gave
her his favour. At the marriage he felt in his heart a
certain high, pure joy that must have been akin to that
in the bride's own heart, for their faces seemed to
speak much alike.</p>

<p>Tensely the little boy listened to the words that
united these two, understanding perfectly from questions
that his hero endowed the woman at his side with
all his worldly goods. Even a less practicable person
than Miss Alvira would have acquired distinction in
this light&mdash;being endowed with the gold horse, to say
nothing of the carven cigar-holder or the precious
jewel in the scarlet cravat. Probably now she would
be able to throw her thumbs out of joint, too!</p>

<p>But to the little boy chiefly the thing meant that
Cousin Bill J. would stay close at hand, to be a joy
forever in his sight and lend importance to the town of
Edom. For his hero was to go and live in the neat
rooms of Miss Alvira over her millinery and dressmaking
shop, and never return to the scenes of his
early prowess.</p>

<p>After the wedding the little boy, on his way to school
of a morning, would watch for Cousin Bill J. to wheel
out on the sidewalk the high glass case in which Miss
Alvira had arranged her pretty display of flowered
bonnets. And slowly it came to life in his understanding
that between the not irksome task of wheeling
out this case in the morning and wheeling it back at
night, Cousin Bill J. now enjoyed the liberty that a man
of his parts deserved. He was free at last to sit about
in the stores of the village, or to enthrone himself
publicly before them in clement weather, at which
time his opinion upon a horse, or any other matter
whatsoever, could be had for the asking. Nor would
he be invincibly reticent upon the subject of those early
exploits which had once set all of Chautauqua County
marvelling at his strength.</p>

<p>At first the little boy was stung with jealousy at this.
Later he came to rejoice in the very circumstance that
had brought him pain. If his hero could not be all his,
at least the world would have to blink even as he had
blinked, in the dazzling light of his excellences&mdash;yes,
and smart under the lash of his unequalled sarcasm.</p>

<p>It should, perhaps, be said that dissolution by slow
poison is not infrequently the fate of an idol.</p>

<p>Doubtless there was never a certain day of which the
little boy could have said &quot;that was the first time
Cousin Bill J. began to seem different.&quot; Yet there
came a moment when all was changed&mdash;a time of
question, doubt, conviction; a terrible hour, in short,
when, face to face with his hero, he suffered the deep
hurt of knowing that mentally, morally, and even
esthetically, he himself was the superior of Cousin Bill J.</p>

<p>He could remember that first he had heard a caller
say to Clytie of Miss Alvira, &quot;Why, they do say the poor
thing has to go down those back stairs and actually
split her own kindlings&mdash;with that healthy loafer setting
around in the good clothes she buys him, in the back
room of that drug-store from morning till night. And
what's worse, he's been seen with that eldest&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Here the caller's eyes had briefly shifted sidewise at
the small listener, whereupon Clytie had urged him to
run along and play like a good boy. He pondered at
length that which he had overheard and then he went to
Miss Alvira's wood-pile at the foot of her back stairs,
reached by turning up the alley from Main Street. He
split a large pile of kindling for her. He would have
been glad to do this each day, had not Miss Alvira
proved to be lacking in delicacy. Instead of ignoring
him, when she saw him from her back window, where
she was second-fitting Samantha Rexford's pink waist,
she came out with her mouth full of pins and gave him
five cents and tried to kiss him. Of course, he never
went back again. If <i>that</i> was the kind she was she
could go on doing the work herself. He was no Ralph
Overton or Ben Holt, to be shamed that way and made
to feel that he had been Doing Good, and be spoken of
all the time as &quot;our Hero.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Cousin Bill J., of <i>course</i> he was a loafer!
Who wouldn't be if he had the chance? But it was
false and cruel to say that he was a healthy loafer.
When Cousin Bill J. was healthy he had been able to
fell an ox with one blow of his fist.</p>

<p>Nor was he disturbed seriously by rumours that his
hero was a &quot;come-outer&quot;; that instead of attending
church with Miss Alvira he could be heard at the barber-shop
of a Sabbath morning, agreeing with Milo Barrus
that God might have made the world in six days and
rested on the seventh; but he couldn't have made the
whale swallow Jonah, because it was against reason
and nature; and, if you found one part of the Bible
wasn't so, how could you tell the rest of it wasn't a lot
of grandmother's tales?</p>

<p>Nor did he feel anything but sympathy for a helpless
man imposed upon when he heard Mrs. Squire Cumpston
say to Clytie, &quot;Do you know that lazy brute has
her worked to a mere shadow; she just sits in that shop
all day long and lets tears fall every minute or so on her
work. She spoiled five-eighths of a yard of three-inch
lavender satin ribbon that way, that was going on to
Mrs. Beasley's second-mourning bonnet. And she's
had to cut him down to twenty-five cents a day for
spending-money, and order the stores not to trust him
one cent on her account.&quot;</p>

<p>He was sorry to have Miss Alvira crying so much.
It must be a sloppy business, making her hats and
things. But what did the woman <i>expect</i> of a man like
Cousin Bill J., anyway?</p>

<p>Yet somehow it came after a few years&mdash;the new
light upon his old idol. One day he found that he
neither resented nor questioned a thing he heard
Clytie herself say about Cousin Bill J.: &quot;Why, he don't
know as much as a goat.&quot; Here she reconsidered,
with an air of wanting to be entirely fair:&mdash;&quot;Well, not
as much as a goat really <i>ought</i> to know!&quot; And when
he overheard old Squire Cumpston saying on the
street, a few days later, &quot;Of all God's mean creatures,
the meanest is a male human that can keep his health
on the money a woman earns!&quot; it was no shock,
though he knew that Cousin Bill J. was meant.</p>

<p>Departed then was the glory of his hero, his splendid
dimensions shrunk, his effective lustre dulled, his
perfect moustache rusted and scraggly, his chin
weakened, his pale blue eyes seen to be in force like
those of a china doll.</p>

<p>He heard with interest that Squire Cumpston had
urged Miss Alvira to divorce her husband, that she
had refused, declaring God had joined her to Cousin
Bill J. and that no man might put them asunder; that
marriage had been raised by Christ to the dignity of a
sacrament and was now indissoluble&mdash;an emblem,
indeed, of Christ's union with His Church; and that,
as she had made her bed, so would she lie upon it.</p>

<p>Nor was the boy alone in regarding as a direct
manifestation of Providence the sudden removal of
Cousin Bill J. from this life by means of pneumonia.
For Miss Alvira had ever been esteemed and respected
even by those who considered that she sang alto half a
note off, while her husband had gradually acquired the
disesteem of almost the entire village of Edom. Many,
indeed, went so far as to consider him a reproach to his
sex.</p>

<p>Yet there were a few who said that even a pretended
observance of the decencies would have been better.
Miss Alvira disagreed with them, however, and after
all, as the village wag, Elias Cuthbert, said in the post-office
next day, &quot;It was <i>her</i> funeral.&quot; For Miss
Alvira had made no pretense to God; and, what is
infinitely harder, she would make none to the world.
She rode to the last resting-place of her husband&mdash;
Elias also made a funny joke about his having merely
changed <i>resting-places</i>&mdash;decked in a bonnet on which
were many blossoms. She had worn it through years
when her heart mourned and life was bitter, when it
seemed that God from His infinity had chosen her to
suffer the cruellest hurts a woman may know&mdash;and
now that He had set her free she was not the one to
pretend grief with some lying pall of cr&ecirc;pe. And on
the new bonnet she wore to church, the first Sabbath
after, there still flowered above her somewhat drawn
face the blossoms of an endless girlhood, as if they were
rooted in her very heart. Beneath these blossoms she
sang her alto&mdash;such as it was&mdash;with just a hint of
tossing defiance. Yet there was no need for that.
Edom thought well of her.</p>

<p>No one was known to have mourned the departed
save an inferior dog he had made his own and been kind
to; but this creature had little sympathy or notice,
though he was said to have waited three days and three
nights on the new earth that topped the grave of Cousin
Bill J. For, quite aside from his unfortunate connection,
he had not been thought well of as a dog.</p>

<h2><a name="ChapterXA"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Passing of the Gratcher; and Another</h3>

<p>From year to year the perfect father came to Edom
to be a week with his children. And though from
visit to visit there were external variations in him,
his genial and refreshing spirit was changeless.
When his garments were appreciably less regal, even
to the kind eye of his younger son; when his hat was not
all one might wish; the boots less than excellent; the
priceless watch-chain absent, or moored to a mere
bunch of aimless keys, though the bounty from his
pockets was an irregular and minute trickle of copper
exclusively, the little boy strutted as proudly by his
side, worshipping him as loyally, as when these outer
affairs were quite the reverse. Yet he could not avoid
being sensible of the fluctuations.</p>

<p>One year the parent would come with the long hair
of one who, having been brother to the red Indian
for years, has wormed from his medicine man the
choicest secret of his mysterious pharmacop&aelig;ia, and
who would out of love for suffering humanity place this
within the reach of all for a nominal consideration.</p>

<p>Another year he would be shorn of the sweeping
moustache and much of the tawny hair, and the little
boy would understand that he had travelled extensively
with a Mr. Haverly, singing his songs each evening in
large cities, and being spoken of as &quot;the phenomenal
California baritone.&quot; His admiring son envied the
fortunate people of those cities.</p>

<p>Again he would be touring the world of cities
with some simple article of household use which,
from his luxurious barouche, he was merely introducing
for the manufacturers&mdash;perhaps a rare cleaning-fluid, a
silver-polish, or that ingenious tool which will sharpen
knives and cut glass, this being, indeed, one of his
prized staples. It appeared&mdash;so the little boy heard him
tell Milo Barrus&mdash;that few men could resist buying a
tool with which he actually cut a pane of glass into
strips before their eyes; that one beholding the sea of
hands waving frantically up to him with quarters in
them, after his demonstration, would have reason to
believe that all men had occasion to slice off a strip of
glass every day or so. Instead of this, as an observer
of domestic and professional life, he believed that out
of the thousands to whom he had sold this tool, not ten
had ever needed to cut glass, nor ever would.</p>

<p>There was another who continued indifferent to the
personal estate of this father. This was Grandfather
Delcher, who had never seen him since that bleak day
when he had tried to bury the memory of his daughter.
When the perfect father came to Edom the grandfather
went to his room and kept there so closely that neither
ever beheld the other. The little boy was much puzzled
by this apparently intentional avoidance of each other
by two men of such rare distinction, and during the
early visits of his father he was fruitful of suggestion
for bringing them together. But when he came to
understand that they remained apart by wish of the
elder man, he was troubled. He ceased then all efforts
to arrange a meeting to which he had looked forward
with pride in his office of exhibiting each personage
to the other. But he was grieved toward his grandfather,
becoming sharp and even disdainful to the queer,
silent old man, at those times when the father was in
the village. He could have no love and but little
friendliness for one who slighted his dear father. And
so a breach widened between them from year to year,
as the child grew stouter fibre into his sentiments of
loyalty and justice.</p>

<p>Meantime, age crept upon the little boy, relentlessly
depriving him of this or that beloved idol, yet not
unkindly leaving with him the pliant vitality that could
fashion others to be still more warmly cherished.</p>

<p>With Nancy, on afternoons when cool shadows lay
across the lawn between their houses, he often discussed
these matters of life. Nancy herself had not been
spared the common fate. Being now a mere graceless
rudiment of humanity, all spindling arms and legs, save
for a puckered, freckled face, she was past the witless
time of expecting to pick up a bird with a broken wing
and find it a fairy godmother who would give her three
wishes. It was more plausible now that a prince, &quot;all
dressed up in shiny Prince Clothes,&quot; would come
riding up on a creamy white horse, lift her to the saddle
in front of him and gallop off, calling her &quot;My beautiful
darling!&quot; while Madmasel, her uncle, and Betsy, the
cook, danced up and down on the front piazza impotently
shouting &quot;Help!&quot; She suspected then, when it
was too late, that certain people would bitterly wish
they had acted in a different manner. If this did not
happen soon, she meant to go into a convent where she
would not be forever told things for her own good by
those arrogantly pretending to know better, and where
she could devote a quiet life to the bringing up of her
children.</p>

<p>The little boy sympathised with her. He knew what
it was to be disappointed in one's family. The family
he would have chosen for his own was that of which two
excellent views were given on the circus bills. In one
picture they stood in line, maddeningly beautiful in
their pink tights, ranging from the tall father and
mother down through four children to a small boy that
always looked much like himself. In the other picture
these meritorious persons were flying dizzily through
the air at the very top of the great tent, from trapeze to
trapeze, with the littlest boy happily in the greatest
danger, midway in the air between the two proud
parents, who were hurling him back and forth.</p>

<p>It was absurd to think of anything like this in connection
with a family of which only one member had
either courage or ambition. One had only to study
Clytie or Grandfather Delcher a few moments to
see how hopeless it all was.</p>

<p>The next best life to be aspired to was that of a house-painter,
who could climb about unchided on the frailest
of high scaffolds, swing from the dizziest cupola, or
sway jauntily at the top of the longest ladder&mdash;always
without the least concern whether he spilled paint on his
clothes or not.</p>

<p>Then, all in a half-hour, one afternoon, both he and
Nancy seemed to cross a chasm of growth so wide that
one thrilled to look back to the farther side where all
objects showed little and all interests were juvenile.
And this phenomenon, signalised by the passing of the
Gratcher, came in this wise. As they rested from
play&mdash;this being a time when the Gratcher was most
likely to be seen approaching by him of the Gratcher-eye,
the usual alarm was given, followed by the usual
unbreathing silence. The little boy fixedly bent his
magic eye around the corner of the house, the little girl
scrambling to him over the grass to clutch one of his
arms, to listen fearfully for the setting of the monster's
crutches at the end of each stride, to feel if the earth
trembled, as it often distinctly did, under his awful
tread.</p>

<p>Wider grew the eyes of both at each &quot;Now he's nearer
still!&quot; of the little boy, until at last the girl must hide
her head lest she see that awful face leering past the
corner. For, once the Gratcher's eye met yours
fairly, he caught you in an instant and worked his will.
This was to pick you up and look at you on all sides
at once with the eyes in his finger-ends, which tickled
you so that you lost your mind.</p>

<p>But now, at the shrillest and tensest report of progress
from the gifted watcher, all in a wondrous second of
realisation, they turned to look into each other's eyes&mdash;
and their ecstasy of terror was gone in the quick little
self-conscious laughs they gave. It was all at once
as if two grown-ups had in a flash divined that they had
been playing at a childish game under some spell. The
moment was not without embarrassment, because of
their having caught themselves in the very act and
frenzy of showing terror of this clumsy fiction. Foolishly
they averted their glances, after that first little laugh of
sudden realisation; but again their eyes met, and this
time they laughed loud and long with a joy that took
away not only all fears of the Gratcher forever, but
their first embarrassment of themselves. Then, with
no word of the matter whatsoever, each knowing that
the other understood, they began to talk of life again,
feeling older and wiser, which truly they were.</p>

<p>For, though many in time wax brave to beard their
Gratcher even in his lair, only the very wise learn this&mdash;
that the best way to be rid of him is to laugh him away
&mdash;that no Gratcher ever fashioned by the ingenuity of
terror-loving humans can keep his evil power over one
to whom he has become funny.</p>

<p>The passing of the Gratcher had left no pedestal
crying for another idol. In its stead, for his own
chastening and with all reverence, the little boy erected
the spirit of that God which the Bible tells of, who is
all-wise and loving, yet no sentimentalist, as witness
his sudden devastations among the first-born of all
things, from white rabbits to men.</p>

<p>But an idol next went down that not only left a
wretched vacancy in the boy's pantheon, but fell
against his heart and made an ugly wound. It was as
if he had become suddenly clear-seeing on that day
when the Gratcher shrivelled in the blast of his laugh.</p>

<p>A little later came the father on his annual visit, and
the dire thing was done. The most ancient and
honoured of all the idols fell with a crash. A perfect
father was lost in some common, swaggering, loud-voiced,
street-mannered creature, grotesquely self-satisfied,
of a cheap, shabby smartness, who came
flaunting those things he should not have flaunted, and
proclaiming in every turn of his showy head his lack
of those things without which the little boy now saw no
one could be a gentleman.</p>

<p>He cried in his bed that night, after futile efforts to
believe that some fearful change had been wrought in his
father. But his memory of former visits was scrupulously
photographic&mdash;phonographic even. He recalled
from the past certain effects once keenly joyed in that
now made his cheeks burn. The things rioted brutally
before him, until it seemed that something inside of
him strove to suppress them&mdash;as if a shamed hand
reached out from his heart to brush the whole offense
into decent hiding with one quick sweep.</p>

<p>This time he took care that Nancy should not meet
his father. Yet he walked the streets with him as
before&mdash;walking defiantly and with shame those streets
through which he had once led the perfect father in
festal parade, to receive the applause of a respectful
populace. Now he went forth awkwardly, doggedly,
keen for signs that others saw what he did, and quick
to burn with bitter, unreasoning resentment, when he
detected that they did so. Once his father rallied him
upon his &quot;grumpiness&quot;; then he grew sullen&mdash;though
trying to smile&mdash;thinking with mortification of his
grandfather. He understood the old man now.</p>

<p>He was glad when the week came to an end. Bruised,
bewildered, shamed, but loyal still and resentful toward
others who might see as he did, he was glad when his
father went&mdash;this time as Professor Alfiretti, doing a
twenty-minute turn of hypnotism and mind-reading
with the Gus Levy All-Star Shamrock Vaudeville,
playing the &quot;ten-twenty-thirties,&quot; whatever they were!</p>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Strong Person's Narrative</h3>

<p>Near the close of the following winter came news of
the father's death. In some town of which the boy
had never heard, in another State, a ramshackle wooden
theatre had burned one night and the father had
perished in the fire through his own foolhardiness.
The news came by two channels: first, a brief and unilluminating
paragraph in the newspaper, giving little
more than the fact itself.</p>

<p>But three days later came a friend of the father,
bringing his few poor effects and a full relation of the
matter. He was a person of kind heart, evidently, to
whom the father had spoken much of his boys in Edom
&mdash;a bulky, cushiony, youngish man who was billed on
the advertising posters of the Gus Levy All-Star
Shamrock Vaudeville as &quot;Samson the Second,&quot; with
a portrait of himself supporting on the mighty arch
of his chest a grand piano, upon which were superimposed
three sizable and busy violinists.</p>

<p>He told his tale to the two boys and Clytie, Grandfather
Delcher having wished to hear no more of the occurrence.</p>

<p>&quot;You understan', it was like this now,&quot; he began,
after having with a calculating eye rejected two proffered
chairs of delicate structure and selected a stout
wooden rocker into which he settled tentatively, as
one whom experience had taught to distrust most
of the chairs in common use.</p>

<p>&quot;The people in front had got out all right, the fire
havin' started on the stage from the strip-light, and also
our people had got out through the little stage-entrance,
though havin' to leave many of our props&mdash;a good coat
I had to lose meself, fur-lined around the collar, by
way of helpin' the Sisters Devere get out their box of
accordions that they done a Dutch Daly act with for
an enn-core. Well, as I was sayin', we'd all hustled
down these back stairs&mdash;they was already red hot and
smokin' up good, you understan', and there we was
shiverin' outside in the snow, kind of rattled, and no
wonder, at that, and the ladies of the troupe histurrical
&mdash;it had come like a quick-change, you understan',
when all of a sudden up in the air goes the Original
Kelly. Say, he lets out a yell for your life&mdash;'Oh, my
God!' he says, 'my kids&mdash;up there,' pointin' to where
the little flames was spittin' out through the side like a
fire-eatin' act. Then down he flops onto his knees in
the snow, prayin' like the&mdash;prayin' like <i>mad</i>, you understan',
and callin' on the blessed Virgin to save little
Patsy, who was just gittin' good with his drum-major
act and whirlin' a fake musket&mdash;and also little Joseph,
who was learnin' to do some card-tricks that wasn't so
bad. Well, so everybody begins to scream louder and
run this way and that, you understan', callin' the kids
and thinkin' Kelly was nutty, because they must 'a got
out. But Kelly keeps right on prayin' to the holy
Virgin, the tears runnin' down his make-up&mdash;say, he
looked awful, on the dead! And then we hears another
yell, and here was Prof. at the window with one of
the kids, sure enough. He'd got up them two flights
of stairs, though they was all red smoky, like when you
see fire through smoke. Well, he motions to catch the
kid, so we snatches a cloak off one of the girls and holds
it out between us, you understan', while he leans out
and drops the kid into it, all safe and sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Just then we seen the place all light up back of him,
and we yelled to him to jump, too&mdash;he could 'a saved
himself, you understan', but he waves his hand and
shook his head&mdash;say, lookin' funny, too, with his
<i>mus</i>-tache half burned off, and we seen him go back
out of sight for the other little Kelly&mdash;Kelly still
promisin' to give up all he had to the Virgin if she
saved his boys.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, for a minute the crowd kep' still, kind 'a
holdin' its breath, you understan', till the Prof.'d come
back with the other kid&mdash;and holdin' it and holdin' it
till the fire gits brighter and brighter through the
window&mdash;and&mdash;nothin' happens, you understan'&mdash;just
the fire keeps on gittin' busy. Honest, I begun to feel
shaky, but then up comes one of these day-after-to-morrow
fire-departments, like they have in them towns,
with some fine painted ladders and a nice new hose-cart,
and there was great doings with these Silases screamin'
to each other a foot away through their fire-trumpets,
only the stairs had been ablaze ever since the Prof. got
up 'em, and before any one does anything the whole
inside caves in and the blaze goes way up to the sky.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course, that settles it, you understan'&mdash;about
the little Kelly and the Prof. We drags the original
Kelly away to a drug-store on the corner of the next
block, where they was workin' over the kid Prof. saved
&mdash;it was Patsy&mdash;and Kelly was crazy; but the Doc.
was bringin' the kid around all right, when one of the
Miss Deveres, she has to come nutty all to once&mdash;say,
she sounded like the parrot-house in Central Park,
laughin' till you'd think she'd bust, only it sounded like
she was cryin' at the same time, and screamin' out at
the top of her voice, 'Oh, he looked so damned funny
with his <i>mus</i>-tache burned off! Oh, he looked so
damned funny with his <i>mus</i>-tache burned off!'&mdash;way
up high like that, over and over. Well, so she has to
be held down till the Doc. jabs her arm full of knockouts.
Honest, I needed the dope myself for fair by
that time, what with the lady bein' that way I'm 'a
tellin' you, and Kelly, the crazy Irishman&mdash;I could
hear him off in one corner givin' his reg'ler stunt about
his friend, O'Houlihan, lately landed and lookin' for
work, comes to a sausage factory and goes up to the
boss and says, 'Begobs!'&mdash;<i>you</i> know the old gag&mdash;say,
I run out in the snow and looked over to the crowd
around the fire and thought of Prof. pokin' around in
that dressin'-room for Kelly's other kid, when he
might 'a jumped after he got the first one, and, say,
this is no kid&mdash;first thing I knew I begin to bawl like
a baby.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, as I was sayin', there I am and all I can see
through the fog is one 'a these here big lighted signs
down the street with 'George's Place' on it, and a
pitcher of a big glass of beer. Me to George's, at once.
When Levy himself finds me there, about daylight,
I'm tryin' to tell a gang of Silases how it all happened
and chokin' up every time so's I have to have another.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course, we break up next day. Kelly tells
me, after he gits right again, that little Patsy was
saved by havin' one 'a these here scapulars on&mdash;he
shows it to me hanging around the kid's neck, inside
his clothes. He says little Joseph must 'a left his off,
or he'd 'a' been saved, too. He showed me a piece in
one 'a these little religious books that says there was
nothing annoyed the devil like a scapular&mdash;that a man
can't be burned or done dirt to in no way if he wears
one. I says it's a pity the Prof. didn't have one on, but
Kelly says they won't work for Protestants. But I
don't know&mdash;I never <i>purtended</i> to be good on these
propositions of religious matters. And there wasn't
any chance of findin' the kid to prove if Kelly had it
right or not.</p>

<p>&quot;But the Prof. he was certainly a great boy for
puttin' up three-sheets about his own two kids; anybody
that would listen&mdash;friend or stranger&mdash;made no difference
to <i>him</i>. He starred 'em to anybody, you
understan'&mdash;what corkers they was, and all like that.
It seemed like Kelly's havin' two kids also kind 'a
touched on his feelin's. Honest, I ain't ever got so
worked up over anything before in me whole life.&quot;</p>

<p>When this person had gone the old man called the
two boys to his room and prayed with them; keeping
the younger to sit with him a long time afterward, as if
feeling that his was the heavier heart.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">A New Theory of a Certain Wicked Man</h3>

<p>The time of the first sorrow was difficult for the boy.
There was that first hard sleep after one we love has
gone&mdash;in which we must always dream that it is not
true&mdash;a sleep from which we awaken to suffer all the
shock of it again. Then came black nights when the
perfect love for the perfect father came back in all its
early tenderness to cry the little boy to sleep. Yet it
went rapidly enough at last, as times of sorrow go for
the young. There even came a day when he found in
a secret place of his heart a chastened, hopeful inquiry
if all might not have been for the best. He had loved
his father&mdash;there had been between them an unbreakable
bond; yet this very love had made him suffer at every
thought of him while he was living, whereas now he
could love him with all tender memories and with no
poisonous misgivings about future meetings with their
humiliations. Now his father was made perfect in
Heaven, and even Grandfather Delcher&mdash;whose aloofness
here he had ceased to blame&mdash;would not refuse to
meet and know him there.</p>

<p>Naturally, then, he turned to his grandfather in his
great need for a new idol to fill the vacant niche.
Aforetime the old man in his study upstairs had been
little more than a gray shadow, a spirit of gloom,
stubbornly imprisoning another spirit that would have
been kind if it could have escaped. But the little boy
drew near to him, and found him curiously companionable.
Where once he had shunned him, he now
went freely to the study with his lessons or his storybook,
or for talk of any little matter. His grandfather,
it seemed, could understand many things which so old
a man could scarcely have been expected to understand.
In token of this there would sometimes creep
over his brown old face a soft light that made it seem
as if there must still be within him somewhere the child
he had once been; as if, perhaps, he looked into the
little boy as into a mirror that threw the sunlight of his
own boyhood into his time-worn face. Side by side,
before the old man's fire, they would talk or muse,
since they were friendly enough to be silent if they
liked. Only one confidence the little boy could not
bring himself to make: he could not tell the old man
that he no longer felt hard toward him, as once he had
done, for his coldness to his father; that he had divined
&mdash;and felt a great shame for&mdash;the true reason of that
coldness. But he thought the old man must understand
without words. It was hardly a matter to be
talked of.</p>

<p>About his other affairs, especially his early imaginings
and difficulties, he was free to talk; about coming to
the Feet, and the Front Room, and being washed in the
blood, and born again&mdash;matters that made the old man
wish their intimacy had not been so long delayed.</p>

<p>But now they made up for lost time. Patiently and
ably he taught the little boy those truths he needed to
know; to seek for eternal life through the atoning blood
of the Saviour, whose part it had been to purchase our
redemption from God's wrath by his death on Calvary.
Of other matters more technical: of how the love that
God of necessity has for His own infinitely perfect being
is the reason and the measure of the hatred he has for
sin. Above all did he teach the little boy how to pray
for the grace of effectual calling, in order that, being
persuaded of his sin and misery, he might thereafter
partake of justification, adoption, sanctification, and
those several benefits which, in this life, do either
accompany or flow from them. They looked forward
with equal eagerness to the day when he should become
a great and good man, preaching the gospel of the
crucified Son to spellbound throngs.</p>

<br>
&quot;They looked forward with equal eagerness
to the day when he should become a great and good man.&quot;
</div>

<p>Together they began again the study of the Scriptures,
the little boy now entering seriously upon that work of
writing commentaries which had once engaged Allan.
In one of these school-boyish papers the old man came
upon a passage that impressed him as notable. It
seemed to him that there was not only that vein of poetic
imagination&mdash;without which one cannot be a great
preacher&mdash;but a certain individual boldness of approach,
monstrous in its na&iuml;ve sentimentality, to be
sure, but indicating a talent that promised to mature
splendidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Now Jesus told his disciples,&quot; it ran, &quot;that he must
be crucified before he could take his seat on the right
hand of God and send to hell those who had rejected
him. He told them that one of them would have to
betray him, because it must be like the Father had said.
It says at the last supper Jesus said, 'The Son of Man
goeth as it is written of him; but woe unto that man by
whom the Son of Man is betrayed; it had been good for
that man if he had not been born.'</p>

<p>&quot;Now it says that Satan entered into Judas, but it
looks to me more like the angel of the Lord might have
entered into him, he being a good man to start with, or
our Lord would not have chosen him to be a disciple.
Judas knew for sure, after the Lord said this, that one
of the disciples had got to betray the Saviour and go to
hell, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not
quenched. Well, Judas loved all the disciples very
much, so he thought he would be the one and save one
of the others. So he went out and agreed to betray him
to the rulers for thirty pieces of silver. He knew if he
didn't do it, it might have to be Peter, James, or John,
or some one the Saviour loved very dearly, because it
<i>had</i> to be one of them. So after it was done and he
knew the others were saved from this foul deed, he went
back to the rulers and threw down their money, and
went out and hung himself. If he had been a bad man,
it seems more like he would have spent that money in
wicked indulgences, food and drink and entertainments,
etc. Of course, Judas knew he would go to hell
for it, so he was not as lucky as Jesus, who knew he
would go to heaven and sit at the right hand of God
when he died, which was a different matter from Judas's,
who would not have any reward at all but going to hell.
It looks to me like poor Judas had ought to be brought
out of hell-fire, and I shall pray Jesus to do it when he
gets around to it.&quot;</p>

<p>However it might be with our Lord's betrayer, there
was one soul now seen to be deservedly in hell. Through
the patient study of the Scriptures as expounded by
Grandfather Delcher, the little boy presently found himself
accepting without demur the old gentleman's unspoken
but sufficiently indicated opinion. His father
was in everlasting torment&mdash;having been not only unbaptised,
but godless and a scoffer. With a quickening
sense of the majesty of that Spirit infinitely good, a new
apprehension of His plan's symmetry, he read the words
meant to explain, to comfort him, silently indicated one
day by the old man:</p>

<p>&quot;Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same
lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto
dishonour?</p>

<p>&quot;What if God, willing to show His wrath, and to
make His power known, endured with much long suffering
the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?</p>

<p>&quot;And that he might make known the riches of his
glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared
unto glory.&quot;</p>

<p>It hurt at first, but the young mind hardened to it
dutifully&mdash;the big, laughing, swaggering, scoffing father
&mdash;a device of God made for torment, that the power of
the All-loving might show forth! If the father had only
repented, he might have gone straight to heaven as did
Cousin Bill J. For the latter had obtained grace
in his last days, and now sang acceptably before the
thrones of the Father and the Son. But the unbaptised
scoffer must burn forever&mdash;and the little boy knew at
last what was meant by &quot;the majesty of God.&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Regrettable Dementia of a Convalescent</h3>

<p>&quot;You know you <i>please</i> me&mdash;<i>really</i> you do!&quot;</p>

<p>Allan, perfect youth of the hazel eyes and tawny
locks, bent upon inquiring Nancy a look of wholly
pleasant reassurance, as one wishful to persuade her
from doubt.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not joking a bit. When I say you please me, I
mean it.&quot;</p>

<p>His look became rather more expansive with a smile
that seemed meant to sympathise guardedly with her in
her necessary rejoicing.</p>

<p>Meekly, for a long second, Nancy drew the black
curtains of her eyes, murmuring from out the friendly
gloom:</p>

<p>&quot;It's very good of you, Allan!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, before he could tell reasons for his pleasing,
which she divined he was about to do, the curtains were
up and the eyes wide open to him with a question about
Bernal.</p>

<p>He turned to the house and pointed up to the two
open windows of the study, in and out of which the
warm breeze puffed the limp white curtains.</p>

<p>&quot;He's there, poor chap! He was able to get that far
for the first time yesterday, leaning on me and Clytie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to think I never knew he was sick until we
came from town last night. I'd surely have left the old
school and come before if I'd heard. I wouldn't have
cared <i>what</i> Aunt Bell said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eight weeks down, and you know we found he'd
been sick long before he found it out himself&mdash;walking
typhoid, they called it. He came home from college
with me Easter week, and Dr. Merritt put him to bed
the moment he clapped eyes on him. Said it was walking
typhoid, and that he must have been worrying
greatly about something, because his nervous system
was all run down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he was very ill?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor Merritt says he went as far as a man can go
and get back at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How dreadful&mdash;poor Bernal! Oh, if he <i>had</i> died!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Out of his head for three weeks at a time&mdash;raving
fearfully. And you know, he's quite like an infant now
&mdash;says the simplest things. He laughs at it himself.
He says he's not sure if he knows how to read and write.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor, dear Bernal!&quot;</p>

<p>With some sudden arousing he studied her face
swiftly as she spoke, then continued:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Bernal's really an awfully good chap at bottom.
&quot; He turned again to look up at the study windows.
&quot;You know, I intend to stand by that fellow
always&mdash;no matter <i>what</i> he does! Of course, I shall
not let his being my brother blind me to his faults&mdash;
doubtless we <i>all</i> have faults; but I tell you,
Nancy, a good heart atones for many things in a
man's make-up.&quot;</p>

<p>She seemed to be waiting, slightly puzzled, but he
broke off&mdash;&quot;Now I must hurry to mail these letters
It's good to be home for another summer. You really
<i>do</i> please me, Nance!&quot;</p>

<p>She thought, as he moved off, that Allan was handsome
&mdash;more than handsome, indeed. He left an immediate
conviction of his superb vitality of body and mind,
the incarnation of a spirit created to prevail. Featured
in almost faultless outline, of a character unconsciously,
unaffectedly proclaiming its superior gravity among
human masses, he was a planet destined to have many
satellites and be satellite to none; an <i>ego</i> of genuine
lordliness; a presence at once masterly and decorative.</p>

<p>And yet she was conscious of a note&mdash;not positively
of discord, but one still exciting a counter-stream of
reflection. She had observed that each time Allan
turned his head, ever so little, he had a way of turning
his shoulders with it: the perfect head and shoulders
were swung with almost a studied unison. And this
little thing had pricked her admiration with a certain
needle-like suspicion&mdash;a suspicion that the young man
might be not wholly oblivious of his merits as a spectacle.</p>

<p>Yet this was no matter to permit in one's mind. For
Nancy of the lengthened skirts and the massed braids
was now a person of reserves. Even in that innocent
insolence of first womanhood, with its tentatively malicious,
half-conscious flauntings, she was one of reticences
toward the world including herself, with petticoats
of decorum draping the child's anarchy of thought
&mdash;her luxuriant young emotions &quot;done up&quot; sedately
with her hair. She was now one to be cautious indeed
of imputations so blunt as this concerning Allan. Besides,
how nobly he had spoken of Bernal. Then she
wondered <i>why</i> it should seem noble, for Nancy would
be always a creature to wonder where another would
accept. She saw it had seemed noble because Bernal
must have been up to some deviltry.</p>

<p>This phrase would not be Nancy's&mdash;only she knew it
to be the way her uncle, for example, would translate
Allan's praise of his brother. She hoped Bernal had
not been very bad&mdash;and wondered <i>how</i> bad.</p>

<p>Then she went to him. Her first little knock brought
no answer, nor could she be sure that the second did.
But she knew it was loud enough to be heard if the room
were occupied, so she gently opened the door a crack
and peeped in. He lay on the big couch across the
room under the open window, a scarlet wool dressing-gown
on, and a steamer-rug thrown over the lower part
of his body. He seemed to be looking out and up to
the tree that appeared above the window. She thought
he could not have heard her, but he called:</p>

<p>&quot;Clytie!&quot;</p>

<p>She crossed the room and bent a little over to meet his
eyes when he weakly turned his head on the pillow.</p>

<p>&quot;Nancy!&quot;</p>

<p>He began to laugh, sliding a thin hand toward one of
hers. The laugh did not end until there were tears in
his eyes. She laughed with him as a strong-voiced
singer would help a weaker, and he tried to put a friendly
force into his grip of the firm-fleshed little hand he had
found.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be flattered, Nance&mdash;it's only typhoid emotion,
&quot; he said at last, in a voice that sounded strangely
unused. &quot;You don't really overcome me, you know
&mdash;the sight of you doesn't unman me as much as these
fond tears might make you suspect. I shall feel that
way when Clytie brings my lunch, too.&quot; He smiled
and drew her hand into both his own as she sat beside
him.</p>

<p>&quot;How plump and warm your hand is&mdash;all full of
little whispering pulses. My hands are cold and
drowsy and bony, and <i>so</i> uninterested! Doesn't
fever bring forward a man's bones in the most
shameless way?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Bernal&mdash;but you'll soon have them decently
hidden again&mdash;indeed, you're looking&mdash;quite&mdash;quite
plump.&quot; She smiled encouragingly. A sudden new
look in his eyes made her own face serious again.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Nance, you're rather lovely when you smile!&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Only then?&quot;</p>

<p>He studied her, while she pretended to be grave.</p>

<p>He became as one apart, giving her a long look of
unbiassed appraisal.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;you know&mdash;now you have some little odds
and ends of features&mdash;not bad&mdash;no, not even half bad,
for that matter. I can see thousands of miles into your
eyes&mdash;there's a fire smouldering away back in there
&mdash;it's all smoky and mysterious after you go the first few
thousand miles&mdash;but, I don't know&mdash;I believe the
smile is <i>needed</i>, Nance. Poor child, I tell you this as a
friend, for your own good&mdash;it seems to make a fine big
perfection out of a lot of little imperfections that are
only fairly satisfactory.&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled again, brushing an escaped lock of hair to
its home.</p>

<p>&quot;Really, Nance, no one could guess that mouth till it
melts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see&mdash;now I shall be going about with an endless,
sickening grin. It will come to that&mdash;doubtless I shall
be murdered for it&mdash;people that do grin that way always
make <i>me</i> feel like murder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And they could never guess your eyes until the little
smile runs up to light their chandeliers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me!&mdash;Like a janitor!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;or the chin, until the little smile does curly things
all around it&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There, now&mdash;calm yourself&mdash;the doctor will be here
presently&mdash;and you know, you're among friends&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;or the face itself until those little pink ripples get
to chasing each other up to hide in your hair, as they are
now. You know you're blushing, Nance, so stop it.
Remember, it's when you smile; remember, also, that
smiles are born, not made. It's a long time since I've
seen you, Nance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two years&mdash;we didn't come here last summer, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you've aged&mdash;you're twice the woman you were
&mdash;so, on the whole, I'm not in the least disappointed in
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your sickness seems to have left you&mdash;well&mdash;in a
remarkably unprejudiced state of mind.&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed. &quot;That's the funny part of it. Did
they tell you this siege had me foolish for weeks?
Honest, now, Nance, here's a case&mdash;how many are
two times two?&quot; He waited expectantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you serious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems silly to you, doesn't it&mdash;but answer as if I
were a child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;twice two are four&mdash;unless my own mind is
at fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There!&mdash;now I begin to believe it. I suppose, now,
it <i>couldn't</i> be anything else, could it? Yesterday morning
the doctor said something was as plain as twice two
are four. You know, the thing rankled in me all day.
It seemed to me that twice two ought to be twenty-two.
Then I asked Clytie and she said it was four, but that
didn't satisfy me. Of course, Clytemnestra is a dear
soul, and I truly, love her, but her advantages in an
educational way have been meagre. She could hardly
be considered an authority in mathematics, even if she
is the ideal cook and friend. But I have more faith in
your learning, Nance. The doctor's solution seems
plausible, since you've sided with him. I suppose you
could have no motive for deceiving me?&quot;</p>

<p>She was regarding him with just a little anxiety, and
this he detected.</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing to worry about, Nance&mdash;it's only funny.
I haven't lost my mind or anything, you know&mdash;spite
of my tempered enthusiasm for your face&mdash;but this is it:
first there came a fearful shock&mdash;something terrible,
that shattered me&mdash;then it seemed as if that sickness
found my brain like a school-boy's slate with all his little
problems worked out on it, and wickedly gave it a
swipe each side with a big wet sponge. And now I
seem to have forgotten all I ever learned. Clytie was
in to feed me the inside of a baked potato before you
came. After I'd fought with her to eat the skin of it&mdash;
such a beautiful brown potato-skin, with delicious
little white particles still sticking to the inside where it
hadn't all been dug out&mdash;and after she had used her
strength as no lady should, and got it away from me, it
came to me all at once that she was my mother. Then
she assured me that she was not, and that seemed quite
reasonable, too. I told her I loved her enough for a
mother, anyway&mdash;and the poor thing giggled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Still, you have your lucid moments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, still thinking about the face? You mean I'm
lucid when you smile, and daffy when you don't. But
that's a case of it&mdash;your face&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My face a case of <i>what</i>? You're getting commercial
&mdash;even shoppy. Really, if this continues, Mr. Linford,
I shall be obliged&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A case of it&mdash;of this blankness of mine. Instead of
continuing my early prejudice, which I now recall was
preposterously in your favour, I survey you coldly for
the first time. You know I'm afraid to look at print
for fear I've forgotten how to read.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;I tell you I feel exactly like one of those chaps
from another planet, who are always reaching here in
the H.G. Wells's stories&mdash;a gentleman of fine attainments
in his own planet, mind you&mdash;bland, agreeable,
scholarly&mdash;with marked distinction of bearing, and a
personal beauty rare even on a planet where the flaunting
of one's secretest bones is held to betoken the only
beauty&mdash;you understand <i>that</i>?&mdash;&mdash;Well, I come
here, and everything is different&mdash;ideals of beauty, people
absurdly holding for flesh on their bones, for example
&mdash;numbers, language, institutions, everything. Of
course, it puzzles me a little, but see the value I ought
to be to the world, having a mature mind, yet one as
clean of preconceptions and prejudice as a new-born
babe's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so that is why you could see that I'm not&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also, why I could see that you <i>are</i>&mdash;that's it, smile!
Nance, you <i>are</i> a dear, when you smile&mdash;you make a
man feel so strong and protecting. But if you knew all
the queer things I've thought in the last week about
time and people and the world. This morning I woke
up mad because I'd been cheated out of the past.
Where <i>is</i> all the past, Nance? There's just as much
past somewhere as there is future&mdash;if one's soul has no
end, it had no beginning. Why not worry about the
past as we do about the future? First thing I'm going
to do&mdash;start a Worry-About-the-Past Club, with dues
and a president, and by-laws and things!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you think I'd better send Clytie, now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; please wait a minute.&quot; He clutched her hand
with a new strength, and raised on his elbow to face her,
then, speaking lower:</p>

<p>&quot;Nance, you know I've had a feeling it wasn't the
right thing to ask the old gentleman this&mdash;he might
think I hadn't been studying at college&mdash;but <i>you</i> tell
me&mdash;what is this about the atoning blood of Jesus
Christ? It was a phrase he used the other day, and it
stuck in my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal&mdash;you surely know!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truly I don't&mdash;it seems a bad dream I've had
some time&mdash;that's all&mdash;some awful dream about my
father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was the part of the Saviour to purchase our
redemption by his death on Calvary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our redemption from what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From sin, to be sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What sin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, our sin, of course&mdash;the sin of Adam which
comes down to us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You say this Jesus purchased our redemption from
that sin by dying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From whom did he purchase it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear&mdash;this is like a catechism&mdash;from God, of
course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The God that made Adam?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes&mdash;now I seem to remember him&mdash;he was supposed
to make people, and then curse them, wasn't he?
And so he had to have his son killed before he could
forgive Adam for our sins?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; before he could forgive <i>us</i> for Adam's sin,
which descended to us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Came down like an entail, eh?... Adam
couldn't disinherit us? Well, how did this God have
his son die?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Bernal&mdash;you <i>must</i> remember, dear&mdash;you
knew so well&mdash;don't you know he was crucified?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure I do&mdash;how stupid! And was God <i>very</i>
cheerful after that? No more trouble about Adam or
anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must hush&mdash;I can't tell you about these things
&mdash;wait till your grandfather comes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I want to have it from you, Nance&mdash;grandad
would think I'd been slighting the classics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, God takes to heaven with him those who
believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Believe what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who believe that Jesus was his only begotten son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does he do with those who don't believe it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I don't know&mdash;really,
Bernal, I must go now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just a minute, Nance!&quot; He clutched more tightly
the hand he had been holding. &quot;I see now! I must
be remembering something I knew&mdash;something that
brought me down sick. If a man doesn't believe God
was capable of becoming so enraged with Adam that
only the bloody death of his own son would appease
his anger toward <i>us</i>, he sends that man where
&mdash;where the worm doeth something or other&mdash;what is it? Oh,
well!&mdash;of course, it's of no importance&mdash;only it came to
me it was something I ought to remember if grandad
should ask me about it. What a quaint belief it must
have been.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I must go!&mdash;let me, now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you find it interesting, Nance, rummaging
among these musty old religions of a dead past&mdash;
though I admit that this one is less pleasant to study
than most of the others. This god seems to lack the
majesty and beauty of the Greek and the integrity of
the Norse gods. In fact, he was too crude to be funny
&mdash;by the way, what is it I seem to recall, about eating
the flesh and drinking the blood of the son?&mdash;'unless
ye eat the flesh of the son&mdash;'&quot;</p>

<p>She drew her hand from his now and arose in some
dismay. He lay back upon his pillow, smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Not very agreeable, is it, Nance? Well, come
again, and I'll tell you about some of the pleasanter
old faiths next time&mdash;I remember now that they interested
me a lot before I was sick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're sure I shouldn't send Clytie or some one?&quot;
She looked down at him anxiously, putting her hand
on his forehead. He put one of his own lightly over
hers.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, thank you! It's not near time yet for the
next baked potato. If Clytie doesn't give up the skin
of this one I shall be tempted to forget that she's a
woman. There, I hear grandad coming, so you won't
be leaving me alone.&quot;</p>

<p>Grandfather Delcher came in cheerily as Nancy left
the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Resting, my boy? That's good. You look brighter
already&mdash;Nancy must come often.&quot;</p>

<p>He took Nancy's chair by the couch and began the
reading of his morning's mail. Bernal lay still with
eyes closed during the reading of several letters; but
when the old man opened out a newspaper with little
rustlings and pats, he turned to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my boy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been thinking of something funny. You know,
my memory is still freakish, and things come back in
splotches. Just now I was recalling a primitive Brazilian
tribe in whose language the word 'we' means
also 'good. 'Others,' which they express by saying
'not we,' means also 'evil.' Isn't that a funny trait of
early man&mdash;we&mdash;good; not we&mdash;bad! I suppose our
own tongue is but an elaboration of that simple bit of
human nature&mdash;a training of polite vines and flowering
shrubs over the crude lines of it.</p>

<p>&quot;And this tribe&mdash;the Baka&iuml;ri, it is called&mdash;is equally
crude in its religion. It is true, sir, is it not, that the
most degraded of the savages tribes resort to human
sacrifice in their religious rites?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Generally true. Human sacrifice was practised
even by some who were well advanced, like the Aztecs
and Peruvians.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir, this Baka&iuml;ri tribe believed that its god
demanded a sacrifice yearly, and their priests taught
them that a certain one of their number had been sent
by their god for this sacrifice each year; that only by
butchering this particular member of the tribe and&mdash;
incredible as it sounds&mdash;eating his body and drinking
his blood, could they avert drouth and pestilence and
secure favours for the year to come. I remember the
historian intimated that it were well not to incur the
displeasure of any priest; that one doing this might
find it followed by an unpleasant circumstance when
the time came for the priests to designate the next
yearly sacrifice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Curious, indeed, and most revolting,&quot; assented the
old man, laying down his paper. &quot;You <i>are</i> feeling
more cheerful, aren't you&mdash;and you look so much
brighter. Ah, what a mercy of God's you were spared
to me!&mdash;you know you became my walking-stick when
you were a very little boy&mdash;I could hardly go far without
you now, my son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir&mdash;thank you&mdash;I've just been recalling some
of the older religions&mdash;Nancy and I had quite a talk
about the old Christian faith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad indeed. I had sometimes been led to
suspect that Nancy was the least bit&mdash;well, frivolous&mdash;
but I am an old man, and doubtless the things that
seem best to me are those I see afar off, their colour
subdued through the years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nancy wasn't a bit frivolous this morning&mdash;on the
contrary, she seemed for some reason to consider me
the frivolous one. She looked shocked at me more
than once. Now, about the old Christian faith, you
know&mdash;their god was content with one sacrifice, instead
of one each year, though he insisted on having the body
eaten and the blood drunk perpetually. Yet I suppose,
sir, that the Christian god, in this limiting of the
human sacrifice to one person, may be said to show a
distinct advance over the god of the Baka&iuml;ri, though
he seems to have been equally a tribal god, whose chief
function it was to make war upon neighbouring
tribes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my boy&mdash;quite so,&quot; replied the old man most
soothingly. He stepped gently to the door. Halfway
down the hall Allan was about to turn into his
room. He came, beckoned by the old man, who said,
in tones too low for Bernal to hear:</p>

<p>&quot;Go quickly for Dr. Merritt. He's out of his head
again.&quot;</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Further Distressing Fantasies of a Clouded Mind</h3>

<p>When young Dr. Merritt came, flushed and important-looking,
greatly concerned by the reported relapse,
he found his patient with normal pulse and temperature
&mdash;rational and joyous at his discovery that the secret
of reading Roman letters was still his.</p>

<p>&quot;I was almost afraid to test it, Doctor,&quot; he confessed,
smilingly, when the little thermometer had been taken
from between his lips, &quot;but it's all right&mdash;I didn't find
a single strange letter&mdash;every last one of them meant
something&mdash;and I know figures, too&mdash;and now I'm as
hungry for print as I am for baked potatoes. You
know, never in my life again, after I'm my own master,
shall I neglect to eat the skin of my baked potato.
When I think of those I let go in my careless days of
plenty, I grow heart-sick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little at a time, young man. If they let you gorge
as you'd like to there would be no more use sending for
me; you'd be a goner&mdash;that's what you'd be! Head
feel all right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine!&mdash;I've settled down to a pleasant reading of
Holy Writ. This Old Testament is mighty interesting
to me, though doubtless I've read it all before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a very complicated case, but I think he's coming
on all right,&quot; the doctor assured the alarmed old man
outside the door. &quot;He may be a little flighty now and
then, but don't pay any attention to him; just soothe
him over. He's getting back to himself&mdash;stronger
every hour. We often have these things to contend
with.&quot;</p>

<p>And the doctor, outwardly confident, went away to
puzzle over the case.</p>

<p>Again the following morning, when Bernal had
leaned his difficult way down to the couch in the study,
the old man was dismayed by his almost unspeakable
aberrations. With no sign of fever, with a cool brow
and placid pulse, in level tones, he spoke the words of
the mad.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, grandad,&quot; he began easily, looking up
at the once more placid old man who sat beside him,
&quot;I am just now recalling matters that were puzzling
me much before the sickness began to spin my head
about so fast on my shoulders. The harder I thought,
the faster my head went around, until it sent my mind
all to little spatters in a circle about me. One thing I
happened to be puzzling over was how the impression
first became current that this god of the Jews was a
being of goodness. Such an impression seems to have
been tacitly accepted for some centuries after the
iniquities so typical of him had been discountenanced
by society&mdash;long after human sacrifice was abhorred,
and even after the sacrificing of animals was held to be
degrading. It's a point that escapes me, owing to my
addled brain; doubtless you can set me right. At
present I can't conceive how the notion could ever have
occurred to any one. I now remember this book well
enough to know that not only is little good ever recorded
of him, but he is so continually barbarous, and so
atrociously cruel in his barbarities. And he was
thought to be all-powerful when he is so pitifully ineffectual,
with all his crude power&mdash;the poor old fellow
was forever bungling&mdash;then bungling again in his efforts
to patch up his errors. Indeed, he would be rather
a pathetic figure if he were not so monstrous! Still,
there is a kind of heathen grandeur about him at times.
He drowns his world full of people because his first two
circumvented him; then he saves another pair, but things
go still worse, so he has to keep smiting the world right
and left, dumb beasts as well as men; and at last he
picks out one tribe, in whose behalf he works a series of
miracles, that devastated a wide area. How he did
love to turn a city over to destruction! And from the
cloud's centre he was constantly boasting of his awful
power, and scaring people into butchering lambs and
things in his honour. Yet, doubtless, that heathen
tribe found its god 'good,' and other people formed
the habit of calling him good, without thinking much
about it. They must have felt queer when they woke
up to the fact that they were calling infinitely good a god
who was not good, even when judged by their poor
human standards.&quot;</p>

<p>Remembering the physician's instructions to soothe
the patient, the distressed old man timidly began&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'For God so loved the world'&quot;&mdash;but he was interrupted
by the vivacious one on the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;That's it&mdash;I remember that tradition. He was
even crude enough to beget a son for human sacrifice,
giving that son power to condemn thereafter those who
should not detect his godship through his human
envelope! That was a rather subtler bit of baseness
than those he first perpetrated&mdash;to send this saving son
in such guise that the majority of his creatures would
inevitably reject him! Oh! he was bound to have his
failures and his tortures, wasn't he? You know, I dare
say the ancient Christians called him good because they
were afraid to call him bad. Doubtless the one great
spiritual advance that we have made since the Christian
faith prevailed is, that we now worship without fearing
what we worship.&quot;</p>

<p>Once more the distressed old man had risen to stand
with assumed carelessness by the door, having writhed
miserably in his chair until he could no longer endure
the profane flood.</p>

<p>&quot;But, truly, that god was, after all, a pathetic figure.
Imagine him amid the ruins of his plan, desolate, always
foiled by his creatures&mdash;meeting failure after failure
from Eden to Calvary&mdash;for even the bloody expedient
of sending his son to be sacrificed did not avail to save
his own chosen people. They unanimously rejected
the son, if I remember, and so he had to be content
with a handful of the despised Gentiles. A sorrowful
old figure of futility he is&mdash;a fine figure for a big epic,
 it seems to me. By the way, what was the date that
 this religion was laughed away. I can remember perfectly
 the downfall of the Homeric deities&mdash;how many
 years there were when the common people believed in
 the divine origin of the Odyssey, while the educated
 classes were more or less discreetly heretical, until at
 last the whole Olympian outfit became poetic myths.
 But strangely enough I do not recall just the date when
 <i>we</i> began to demand a god of dignity and morality.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man had been loath to leave the sufferer.
He still stood by the open door to call to the first passer-by.
Now, shudderingly wishful to stem the torrent
of blasphemies, innocent though they were, he ventured
cautiously:</p>

<p>&quot;There was Sinai&mdash;you forget the tables&mdash;the
moral law&mdash;the ten commandments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sinai, to be sure. Christians used to regard that
as an occasion of considerable dignity, didn't they?
The time when he gave directions about slavery and
divorce and polygamy&mdash;he was beautifully broad-minded
in all those matters, and to kill witches and to
stone an ox that gored any one, and how to disembowel
the lambs used for sacrifice, and what colours to use
in the tabernacle.&quot;</p>

<p>But the horrified old man had fled. Half an hour
later he returned with Dr. Merritt, relieving Clytie,
who had watched outside the door and who reported
that there had been no signs of violence within.</p>

<p>Again they found a normal pulse and temperature,
and an appetite clamouring for delicacies of strong
meat. Young Dr. Merritt was greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand the case perfectly,&quot; he said to the old
man; &quot;he needs rest and plenty of good nursing&mdash;and
quiet. We often have these cases. Your head feels
all right, doesn't it?&quot; he asked Bernal.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine, Doctor!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought so.&quot; He looked shrewdly at the old man. &quot;
Your grandfather had an idea you might be&mdash;perhaps
a bit excited.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;not a bit. We've had a fine morning chatting
over some of the primitive religions, haven't we, old
man?&quot; and he smiled affectionately up to his grandfather.
&quot;Hello, Nance, come and sit by me.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl had paused in the doorway while he spoke,
and came now to take his hand, after a look of inquiry
at the two men. The latter withdrew, the eyes of the old
man sadly beseeching the eyes of the physician for some
definite sign of hope.</p>

<p>Inside, the sufferer lay holding a hand of Nancy
between his cheek and the pillow&mdash;with intervals of
silence and blithe speech. His disordered mind, it
appeared, was still pursuing its unfortunate tangent.</p>

<p>&quot;The first ideas are all funny, aren't they, Nance?
Genesis in that Christian mythology we were discussing
isn't the only funny one. There was the old northern
couple who danced on the bones of the earth nine times
and made nine pairs of men and women; and there were
the Greek and his wife who threw stones out of their
ark that changed to men; and the Hindu that saved the
life of a fish, and whom the fish then saved by fastening
his ship to his horn; and the South Sea fisherman who
caught his hook in the water-god's hair and made him
so angry that he drowned all the world except the
offending fisherman. Aren't they nearly as funny as
the god who made one of his pair out of clay and one
from a rib, and then became so angry with them that
he must beget a son for them to sacrifice before he would
forgive them? Let's think of the pleasanter ones. Do
you know that hymn of the Veda?&mdash;'If I go along trembling
like a cloud, have mercy, Almighty, have mercy!'</p>

<p>&quot;'Through want of strength, thou strong and bright
God, have I gone wrong. Have mercy, Almighty, have
mercy!'</p>

<p>&quot;And Buddha was a pleasant soul, Nance&mdash;with
stuff in him, too&mdash;born a prince, yet leaving his palace
to be poor and to study the ways of wisdom, until
enlightenment came to him sitting under his Bo tree.
He said faith was the best wealth here. And, 'Not to
commit any sin, to do good and to purify one's mind,
that is the teaching of the awakened'; 'not hating those
who hate us,' 'free from greed among the greedy.'
They must have been glad of Buddhism in their day,
teaching them to honour their parents, to be kind to the
sick and poor and sorrowing, to forgive their enemies
and return good for evil. And there was funny old
Confucius with his 'Coarse rice for food, water to
drink, the bended arm for a pillow&mdash;happiness may be
enjoyed even with these; but without virtue, both
riches and honour seem to me like the passing cloud.'
Another one of his is 'In the book of Poetry are three
hundred pieces&mdash;but the designs of them all mean,
&quot;Have no depraved thoughts.&quot;' Rather good for a
Chinaman, wasn't it?</p>

<p>&quot;And there was old Zoroaster saying to his Ormuzd,
'I believe thee, O God! to be the best thing of all!' and
asking for guidance. Ormuzd tells him to be pure in
thought, word and deed; to be temperate, chaste and
truthful&mdash;and this Ormuzd would have no lambs sacrificed
to him. Life, being his gift, was dear to him.
And don't forget Mohammed, Nance, that fine old
barbarian with the heart of a passionate child, counselling
men to live a good life and to strive after the mercy
of God by fasting, charity and prayer, calling this the
'Key of Paradise.' He went after a poor blind man
whom he had at first rebuffed, saying 'He is thrice
welcome on whose account my Lord hath reprimanded
me.' He was a fine, stubborn old believer, Nance. I
wonder if it's not true that the Christians once studied
these old chaps to take the taste of their own cruder
God out of their minds. What a cruel people they
must have been to make so cruel a God!</p>

<p>&quot;But let's talk of you, Nance&mdash;that's it&mdash;light the
chandeliers in your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke drowsily now, and lay quiet, patting one of
her hands. But presently he was on one elbow to study
her again.</p>

<p>&quot;Nance, the Egyptians worshipped Nature, the
Greeks worshipped Beauty, the Northern chaps worshipped
Courage, and the Christians feared&mdash;well, the
hereafter, you know&mdash;but I'm a Catholic when you
smile.&quot;</p>

<br>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc2">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Reason Is Again Enthroned</h3>

<p>Slowly the days brought new life to the convalescent,
despite his occasional attacks of theological astigmatism.
And these attacks grew less frequent and less
marked as the poor bones once more involved themselves
in firm flesh&mdash;to the glad relief of a harried and
scandalised old gentleman whose black forebodings
had daily moved him to visions of the mad-house for
his best-loved descendant.</p>

<p>Yet there were still dreadful times when the young
man on the couch blasphemed placidly by the hour,
with an insane air of assuming that those about him
held the same opinions; as if the Christian religion were
a pricked bubble the adherents of which had long since
vanished.</p>

<p>If left by himself he could often be heard chuckling
and muttering between chuckles: &quot;I will get me honour
upon Pharaoh and all his host. I have hardened his
heart and the heart of his host that I might show these
my signs before him.&quot;</p>

<p>Entering the room, the old gentleman might be met
with:</p>

<p>&quot;I certainly agree with you, sir, in every respect&mdash;
Christianity was an invertebrate materialism of separation
&mdash;crude, mechanical separation&mdash;less spiritual, less
ethical, than almost any of the Oriental faiths. Affirming
the brotherhood of man, yet separating us into a
heaven and a hell. Christians cowering before a being
of divided power, half-god and half-devil. Indeed, I
remember no religion so non-moral&mdash;none that is so
baldly a mere mechanical device for meeting the primitive
mind's need to set its own tribe apart from all
others&mdash;or in the later growth to separate the sheep
from the goats, by reason of the opinion formed of certain
evidence. Even schoolboys nowadays know that
no moral value inheres in any opinion formed upon
evidence. Yet, I dare say it was doubtless for a long
period an excellent religion for marauding nations.&quot;</p>

<p>Or, again, after a long period of apparently rational
talk, the unfortunate young man would break out with,
&quot;And how childish its wonder-tales were, of iron made
to swim, of a rod turned to a serpent, of a coin found in
a fish's mouth, of devils asking to go into swine, of a
fig-tree cursed to death because it did not bear fruit
out of season&mdash;how childish that tale of a virgin mother,
who conceived 'without sin,' as it is somewhere
na&iuml;vely put&mdash;an ideal of absolutely flawless falsity.
Even the great old painters were helpless before it.
They were driven to make mindless Madonnas, stupid
bits of fleshy animality. It's not easy to idealise mere
physical motherhood. You see, that was the wrong,
perverted idea of motherhood&mdash;'conceiving without
sin.' It's an unclean dogma in its implications. I
knew somewhere once a man named Milo Barrus&mdash;a
sort of cheap village atheist, I remember, but one thing
I recall hearing him say seems now to have a certain
crude truth in it. He said: 'There's my old mother,
seventy-eight this spring, bent, gray, and wasted with
the work of raising us seven children; she's slaved so
hard for fifty years that she's worn her wedding-ring
to a fine thread, and her hands look as if they had a
thousand knuckles and joints in them. But she smiles
like a girl of sixteen, she was never cross or bitter to
one of us hounds, and I believe she never even
<i>wanted</i> to complain in all her days. And there's a look
of noble capacity in her face, of soul dignity, that you
never saw in any Madonna's. I tell you no &quot;virgin
mother&quot; could be as beautiful as my mother, who bore
seven children for love of my father and for love of the
thought of us.' Isn't it queer, sir, that I remember
that&mdash;for it seemed only grotesque at the time I heard
it.&quot;</p>

<p>It was after this extraordinary speech, uttered with
every sign of physical soundness, that young Dr. Merritt
confided to the old man when they had left the study:</p>

<p>&quot;He's coming on fine, Mr. Delcher. He'll eat himself
into shape now in no time; but&mdash;I don't know&mdash;
seems to me you stand a lot better show of making a
preacher out of his brother. Of course, I may be mistaken
&mdash;we doctors often are.&quot; Then the young physician
became loftily humble: &quot;But it doesn't strike me
he'll ever get his ideas exactly into Presbyterian shape
again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, man, he'll surely be rid of these devil's hallucinations?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well&mdash;perhaps, but I'm almost afraid they're
 what we doctors call 'fixed delusions.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I set my heart so long ago on his preaching the
Word. Oh, I've looked forward to it so long&mdash;and so
hard!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, all you can do now is to feed him and not
excite him. We often have these cases.&quot;</p>

<p>The very last of Bernal's utterances that could have
been reprobated in a well man was his telling Clytie in
the old gentleman's presence that, whereas in his boyhood
he had pictured the hand of God as a big black
hand reaching down to &quot;remove&quot; people&mdash;&quot;the way you
weed an onion bed&quot;&mdash;he now conceived it to be like her
own&mdash;&quot;the most beautiful fat, red hand in the world,
always patting you or tucking you in, or reaching you
something good or pointing to a jar of cookies.&quot; It
was so dangerously close to irreverence that it made
Clytemnestra look stiff and solemn as she arranged
matters on the luncheon tray; yet it was so inoffensive,
considering the past, that it made Grandfather Delcher
quite hopeful.</p>

<p>Thereafter, instead of babbling blasphemies, the convalescent
became silent for the most part, yet cheerful
and beautifully rational when he did speak, so that fear
came gradually to leave the old man's heart for longer
and longer intervals. Indeed, one day when Bernal
had long lain silent, he swept lingering doubts from the
old man's mind by saying, with a curious little air of
embarrassment, yet with a return of that old-time playful
assumption of equality between them&mdash;&quot;I'm afraid,
old man, I may have been a little queer in my talk&mdash;
back there.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man's heart leaped with hope at this, though
the acknowledgment struck him as being inadequate
to the circumstance it referred to.</p>

<p>&quot;You <i>were</i> flighty, boy, now and then,&quot; he replied,
in quite the same glossing strain of inadequacy.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't tell you how queerly things came back to
me&mdash;some bits of consciousness and memory came early
and some came late&mdash;and they're still struggling along
in that disorderly procession. Even yet I've not been
able to take stock. Old man, I must have been an
awful bore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no&mdash;not <i>that</i>, boy!&quot; Then, in glad relief, he
fell upon his knees beside the couch, praying, in discreetly
veiled language, that the pure heart of a babbler
might not be held guilty for the utterances of an
irresponsible head.</p>

<p>Yet, after many days of sane quiet and ever-renewing
strength&mdash;days of long walks in the summer woods or
long readings in the hammock when the shadows lay
east of the big house, there came to be observed in the
young man a certain moody reticence. And when the
time for his return to college was near, he came again
to his disquieted grandfather one day, saying:</p>

<p>&quot;I think there are some matters I should speak to
you about, sir.&quot; Had he used the term &quot;old man,&quot;
instead of &quot;sir,&quot; there might still have been no cause
for alarm. As it was, the grandfather regarded him in
a sudden, heart-hurried fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Are the matters, boy, those&mdash;those about which
you may have spoken during your sickness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe so, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man winced again under the &quot;sir,&quot; when
his heart longed for the other term of playful familiarity.
But he quickly assumed a lightness of manner to hide
the eagerness of his heart's appeal:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Don't</i> talk now, boy&mdash;be advised by me. It's not
well for you&mdash;you are not strong. Please let me guide
you now. Go back to your studies, put all these matters
from your mind&mdash;study your studies and play your
play. Play harder than you study&mdash;you need it more.
Play out of doors&mdash;you must have a horse to ride. You
have thought too much before your time for thinking.
Put away the troublesome things, and live in the flesh
as a healthy boy should. Trust me. When you come
to&mdash;to those matters again, they will not trouble you.&quot;</p>

<p>In his eagerness, first one hand had gone to the boy's
shoulder, then the other, and his tones grew warm with
pleading, while the keen old eyes played as a searchlight
over the troubled young face.</p>

<p>&quot;I must tell you at least one thing, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man forced a smile around his trembling
mouth, and again assumed his little jaunty lightness.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come, boy&mdash;not 'sir.' Call me 'old man'
and you shall say anything.&quot;</p>

<p>But the boy was constrained, plainly in discomfort.
&quot;I&mdash;I can't call you that&mdash;just now&mdash;sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you <i>must</i>, tell me one thing&mdash;but only one!
only one, mind you, boy!&quot; In fear, but smiling, he
waited.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir, it's a shock I suffered just before I was
sick. It came to me one night when I sat down to dinner
&mdash;fearfully hungry. I had a thick English chop on the
plate before me; and a green salad, oily in its bowl, and
crisp, browned potatoes, and a mug of creamy ale. I'd
gone to the place for a treat. I'd been whetting my
appetite with nibbles of bread and sips of ale until the
other things came; and then, even when I put my knife
to the chop&mdash;like a blade pushed very slowly into my
heart came the thought: 'My father is burning in hell&mdash;
screaming in agony for a drop of this water which I shall
not touch because I have ale. He has been in this agony
for years; he will be there forever.' That was enough,
sir. I had to leave the little feast. I was hungry no
longer, though a moment before it had seemed that
I couldn't wait for it. I walked out into the cold, raw
night&mdash;walked till near daylight, with the sweat running
off me. And the thing I knew all the time was this:
that if I were in hell and my father in heaven, he would
blaspheme God to His face for a monster and come to
hell to burn with me forever&mdash;come with a joke and a
song, telling me never to mind, that we'd have a fine
time there in hell in spite of everything! That was
what I knew of my poor, cheap, fiddle-playing mountebank
of a father. Just a moment more&mdash;this is what
you must remember of me, in whatever I have to say
hereafter, that after that night I never ceased to suffer
all the hell my father could be suffering, and I suffered
it until my mind went out in that sickness. But, listen
now: whatever has happened&mdash;I'm not yet sure what
it is&mdash;I no longer suffer. Two things only I know:
that our creed still has my godless, scoffing, unbaptised
father in hell, and that my love for him&mdash;my absolute
<i>oneness</i> with him&mdash;has not lessened.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll stop there, if you wish, leaving you to divine
what other change has taken place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There, there,&quot; soothed the old man, seizing the
shoulders once more with his strong grip&mdash;&quot;no more
now, boy. It was a hard thing, I know. The consciousness
of God's majesty comes often in that way,
and often it overwhelms the unprepared. It was hard,
but it will leave you more a man; your soul and your
faith will both survive. Do what I have told you&mdash;as
if you were once more the puzzled little Bernal,
who never could keep his hair neatly brushed like
Allan, and would always moon in corners. Go finish
your course. Another year, when your mind has new
fortitude from your recreated body, we will talk
these matters as much as you like. Yet I will
tell you one thing to remember&mdash;just one, as you have
told me one: You are in a world of law, of unvarying
cause and effect; and the integrity of this law cannot
be destroyed, nor even impaired, by any conceivable
rebellion of yours. Yet this material world of law is
but the shadow of the reality, and that reality is God&mdash;
the moral law if you please, as relentless, as inexorable,
as immutable in its succession of cause and effect as the
physical laws more apparent to us; and as little to be
overthrown as physical law by any rebellion of disordered
sentiment. The word of this God and this Law
is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testaments, wherein is the only rule to direct us how
we may glorify and enjoy Him.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; continued the old man, more lightly, &quot;each
of us has something to remember&mdash;and let each of us
pray for the other. Go, be a good boy&mdash;but careless
and happy&mdash;for a year.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man had his way, and the two boys went
presently back to their studies.</p>

<p>The girl, Nancy, remembered them well for the
things each had said to her.</p>

<p>Allan, who, though he constantly praised her, had
always the effect of leaving her small to herself. &quot;Really,
Nance,&quot; he said, &quot;without any joking, I believe you have
a capacity for living life in its larger aspects.&quot;</p>

<p>And on the last day, Bernal had said, &quot;Nance, you
remember when we were both sorry you couldn't be
born again&mdash;a boy? Well, from what the old gentleman
says, one learns in time to bow to the ways of
an inscrutable Providence. I dare say he's right. I
can see reasons now, my girl, why it was well that
you were not allowed to meddle with Heaven's allotment
of your sex. I'm glad you had to remain a
girl.&quot;</p>

<p>One compliment pleased her. The other made her
tremble, though she laughed at it.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Few Letters</h3>

<p>(From Bernal Linford to the Reverend Allan Delcher.)</p>

<p><i>Dear Grandfather:</i> The college year soon ends; also my
course. I think you hoped I wouldn't want again to talk
of those matters. But it isn't so. I am primed and waiting,
and even you, old man, must listen to reason. The
world of thought has made many revolutions since you shut
yourself into that study with your weekly church paper.
So be ready to hear me.</p>

<p>Affectionately,<br>
BERNAL LINFORD.</p>

<p>(From the Reverend Allan Delcher to Bernal Linford.)</p>

<p>&quot;Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man
upright, but they have sought out many inventions.&quot; I am
sending you a little book.</p>

<p>GRANDFATHER.</p>

<p>(From Bernal Linford to the Reverend Allan Delcher.)</p>

<p><i>Dear Old Man</i>: How am I going to thank you for the
&quot;little book&quot;&mdash;for Butler's Analogy? Or rather, how shall
I forgive you for keeping it from me all these years? I see
that you acquired it in 1863&mdash;and I never knew! I must
tell you that I looked upon it with suspicion when I unwrapped
it&mdash;a suspicion that the title did not allay. For
I recalled the last time you gave me a book&mdash;the year before
I came here. That book, my friend, was &quot;Rasselas, Prince
of Abyssinia.&quot; I began it with deep respect for you. I
finished with a profound distrust of all Abyssinians and an
overwhelming grief for the untimely demise of Mrs. Johnson
&mdash;for you had told me that the good doctor wrote this
book to get money to bury her. How the circle of mourners
for that estimable woman must have widened as Rasselas
made its way out into the world! Oh, Grandad, if only they
had been able to keep her going some way until he needn't
have done it! If only she could have been spared until her
son got in a little money from the Dictionary or something!</p>

<p>All of which is why I viewed with unfriendly distrust your
latest gift, the Analogy of Joseph Butler, late Lord Bishop
of Durham. But, honestly, old man, did you know how
funny it was when you sent it? It's funnier than any of the
books of Moses, without being bloody. What a dear, innocent
old soul the Bishop is! How sincerely he believes he
is reasoning when he is merely doing a roguish two-step
down the grim corridor of the eternal verities&mdash;with a little
jig here and there, and a pause to flirt his frock airily in the
face of some graven image of Fact. Ah, he is so weirdly
innocent. Even when his logical toes go blithely into the
air, his dear old face is most resolutely solemn, and I believe
he is never in the least aware of his frivolous caperings over
the floor of induction. Indeed, his unconsciousness is what
makes him an unfailing delight. He even makes his good
old short-worded Saxon go in lilting waltz-time.</p>

<p>You will never know, Grandad, what this book has done
for me. I am stimulated in the beginning by this: &quot;From
the vast extent of God's dominion there must be some
things beyond our comprehension, and the Christian scheme
may be one of them.&quot; And at the last I am soothed with
this heart-rending <i>pas seul</i>: &quot;Concluding remarks by which
it is clearly shown that those men who can evade the force of
arguments so probable for the truth of Christianity undoubtedly
possess dispositions to evil which would cause them to
reject it, were it based on the most absolute demonstration.&quot;
Is not that a pearl without price in this world of lawful conclusions?</p>

<p>By the way, Grandad&mdash;recalling the text you quote in your
last&mdash;did you know when you sent me to this university that
the philosophy taught, in a general way, is that of Kant; that
most university scholars smile pityingly at the Christian
thesis? Did you know that belief in Genesis had been
laughed away in an institution like this? With no intention
of diverting you, but merely in order to acquaint you with
the present state of popular opinion on a certain matter, I
will tell you of a picture printed in a New York daily of yesterday.
It's on the funny page. A certain weird but funny-looking
beast stands before an equally funny-looking Adam,
in a funny Eden, with a funny Eve and a funny Cain and
Abel in the background. The animal says, &quot;Say, Ad.,
what did you say my name was? I've forgotten it again.&quot;
Our first male parent answers somewhat testily, as one who
has been vexed by like inquiries: &quot;Icthyosaurus, you
darned fool! Can't you remember a little thing like that?&quot;</p>

<p>In your youth this would doubtless have been punished as
a crime. In mine it is laughed at by all classes. I tell you
this to show you that the Church to-day is in the position of
upholding a belief which has become meaningless because
its foundation has been laughed away. Believing no longer
in the god of Moses who cursed them, Christians yet assume
to believe in their need of a Saviour to intercede between
them and this exploded idol of terror. Unhappily, I am so
made that I cannot occupy that position. To me it is not
honest.</p>

<p>Old man, do you remember a certain saying of Squire
Cumpston? It was this: &quot;If you're going to cross the
Rubicon, <i>cross</i> it! Don't wade out to the middle and stand
there: you only get hell from both banks!&quot;</p>

<p>And so I have crossed; I find the Squire was right about
standing in the middle. Happily, or unhappily, I am compelled
to believe my beliefs with all my head and all my
heart. But I am confident my reasons will satisfy you when
you hear them. You will see these matters <i>in a new light</i>.</p>

<p>Believe me, Grandad, with all love and respect,</p>

<p>Affectionately yours,<br>
BERNAL LINFORD.</p>

<p>(From the Reverend Allan Delcher to Bernal Linford.)</p>

<p><i>My Boy:</i> For one bitten with skepticism there is little
argument&mdash;especially if he be still in youth, which is a time
of raw and ready judgments and of great spiritual self-sufficiency.
You wanted to go to Harvard. I wanted you
to go to Princeton, because of its Presbyterianism and
because, too, of Harvard's Unitarianism. We compromised
on Yale&mdash;my own alma mater, as it was my father's. To
my belief, this was still, especially as to its pulpit, the stronghold
of orthodox Congregationalism. Was I a weak old
man, compromising with Satan? Are you to break my heart
in these my broken years? For love of me, as for the love of
your own soul, <i>pray</i>. Leave the God of Moses until your
soul's stomach can take the strong meat of him&mdash;for he <i>is</i>
strong meat&mdash;and come simply to Jesus, the meek and gentle&mdash;
the Redeemer, who died that his blood might cleanse
our sin-stained souls. Centre your aspirations upon Him,
for He is the rock of our salvation, if we believe, <i>or the rock
of our wrecking to endless torment if we disbelieve</i>. Do not
deny our God who is Jesus, nor disown Jesus who is our
God, nor yet question the inerrance of Holy Writ&mdash;yea, with
its everlasting burnings. &quot;He that believeth and is baptised
shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be
damned.&quot;</p>

<p>I am sad. I have lived too long.</p>

<p>GRANDFATHER.</p>

<p>(From Bernal Linford to the Reverend Allan Delcher.)</p>

<p><i>Grandad:</i> It's all so plain, you must see it. I told you I
had crossed to the farther bank. Here is what one finds
there: Taking him as God, Jesus is ineffectual. Only as
an obviously fallible human man does he become beautiful;
only as a man is he dignified, worthy, great&mdash;or even plausible.</p>

<p>The instinct of the Jews did not mislead them. Jesus
was too fine, too good, to have come from their tribal god;
yet too humanly limited to have come from God, save as
we all come from Him.</p>

<p>Since you insist that he be considered as God, I shall point
out those things which make him small&mdash;as a God. I would
rather consider him as a man and point out those things
which make him great to me&mdash;things which I cannot read
without wet eyes&mdash;but you will not consider him as man, so
let him be a God, and let us see what we see. It is customary
to speak of his &quot;sacrifice.&quot; What was it? Our
catechism says, &quot;Christ's humiliation consisted in his being
born, and that in a low condition, made under the law, undergoing
the miseries of this life, the wrath of God and the
cursed death of the cross; in being buried and continuing
under the power of death for a time.&quot;</p>

<p>As I write the words I wonder that the thing should ever
have seemed to any one to be more than a wretched piece of
God-jugglery, devoid of integrity. Are we to conceive God
then as a being of carnal appetites, humiliated by being
born into the family of an honest carpenter, instead of into
the family of a King? This is the somewhat snobbish
imputation.</p>

<p>Let us be done with gods playing at being human, or at
being half god and half human. The time has come when,
to prolong its usefulness, the Church must concede&mdash;nay,
proclaim&mdash;the manhood of Jesus; must separate him from
that atrocious scheme of human sacrifice, the logical extension
of a primitive Hebrew mythology&mdash;and take him in
the only way that he commands attention: As a man, one
of the world's great spiritual teachers. Insisting upon his
godship can only make him preposterous to the modern
mind. Jesus, born to a carpenter's wife of Nazareth,
declares himself, one day about his thirtieth year, to be the
Christ, the second person in the universe, who will come in a
cloud of glory to judge the world. He will save into everlasting
life those who believe him to be of divine origin.
Yet he has been called meek! Surely never was a more
arrogant character in history&mdash;never one less meek than
this carpenter's son who ranks himself second only to God,
with power to send into everlasting hell those who disbelieve
him! He went abroad in fine arrogance, railing at lawyers
and the rich, rebuking, reproving, hurling angry epithets,
attacking what we to-day call &quot;the decent element.&quot; He
called the people constantly &quot;Fools,&quot; &quot;Blind Leaders of
the Blind,&quot; &quot;faithless and perverse,&quot; &quot;a generation of
vipers,&quot; &quot;sinful,&quot; &quot;evil and adulterous,&quot; &quot;wicked,&quot; &quot;hypocrites,&quot;
&quot;whited sepulchres.&quot;</p>

<p>As the god he worshipped was a tribal god, so he at first
believed himself to be a tribal saviour. He directed his
disciples thus: &quot;Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and
into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather
to the lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot;&mdash;(who emphatically
rejected and slew him for his pretensions). To the woman
of Canaan whose daughter was vexed with a devil, he said:
&quot;It is not meet to take the children's bread to cast it to dogs.&quot;
Imagine a God calling a woman a dog <i>because she was not of
his own tribe!</i></p>

<p>And the vital test of godhood he failed to meet: It is his
own test, whereby he disproves his godship out of his own
mouth. Compare these sayings of Jesus, each typical of
him:</p>

<p>&quot;Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
right cheek, turn to him the other also.&quot; Yet he said to his
Twelve:</p>

<p>&quot;And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you, when
you depart thence shake off the dust of your feet for a testimony
against them.&quot;</p>

<p>Is that the consistency of a God or a man?</p>

<p>Again: &quot;Blessed are the merciful,&quot; <i>but</i> &quot;Verily I say
unto you it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah
in the day of judgment than for that city.&quot; Is this the
mercy which he tells us is blessed?</p>

<p>Again: &quot;And as ye would that men should do to you do
ye also to them likewise.&quot; Another: &quot;Woe unto thee,
Chorazin, woe unto thee, Bethsaida... and thou,
Capernaum, which are exalted unto heaven, shall be brought
down to hell.&quot; Is not this preaching the golden rule and
practicing something else, as a man might?</p>

<p>Again: &quot;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you and persecute you.</p>

<p>&quot;For if ye love them which love you, what reward have
ye? Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye
salute your brethren, what do ye more than others? Do not
even the publicans so?&quot; That, sir, is a sentiment that
proves the claim of Jesus to be a teacher of morals. Here
is one which, placed beside it, proves him to have been a
man.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the son
of man also confess before the angels of God;</i></p>

<p><i>&quot;but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also
deny before my father, which is in heaven.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Is it God speaking&mdash;or man? <i>&quot;Do not even the publicans
so?&quot;</i></p>

<p>Beside this very human contradiction, it is hardly worth
while to hear him say &quot;Resist not evil,&quot; yet make a scourge
of cords to drive the money-changers from the temple in a
fit of rage, human&mdash;but how ungodlike!</p>

<p>Believe me, the man Jesus is better than the god Jesus;
the man is worth while, for all his inconsistencies, partly due
to his creed and partly to his emotional nature. Indeed,
we have not yet risen to the splendour of his ideal&mdash;even the
preachers will not preach it.</p>

<p>And the miracles? We need say nothing of those, I think.
If a man disprove his godship out of his own mouth, we shall
not be convinced by a coin in a fish's mouth or by his raising
Lazarus, four days dead. So long as he says, &quot;I will confess
him that confesseth me and deny him that denieth me,&quot;
we should know him for one of us, though he rose from the
dead before our eyes.</p>

<p>Then at the last you will say, &quot;By their fruits ye shall
know them.&quot; Well, sir, the fruits of Christianity are what
one might expect. You will say it stands for the fatherhood
of God and the brotherhood of man. That it has always
done the reverse is Christianity's fundamental defect, and
its chief absurdity in this day when the popular unchurchly
conception of God has come to be one of some dignity.</p>

<p>&quot;That ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference
between the Egyptians and Israel.&quot; There is the rock
of separation upon which the Church builded; the rock
upon which it will presently split. The god of the Jews set
a difference between Israel and Egypt. So much for the
fatherhood of God. The Son sets the same difference,
dividing the sheep from the goats, according to the opinions
they form of his claim to godship. So much for the brotherhood
of man. Christianity merely caricatures both propositions.
Nor do I see how we can attain any worthy ideal
of human brotherhood while this Christianity prevails: We
must be sheep and goats among ourselves, some in heaven,
some in hell, still seeking out reasons &quot;Why the Saints in
Glory Should Rejoice at the Sufferings of the Damned.&quot;
We shall be saints and sinners, sated and starving. A God
who separates them in some future life will have children
that separate themselves here upon His own very excellent
authority. That is why one brother of us must work himself
to death while another idles himself to death&mdash;because
God has set a difference, and his Son after him, and the
Church after that. The defect in social Christendom
to-day, sir, is precisely this defect of the Christian faith&mdash;
its separation, its failure to teach what it chiefly boasts of
teaching. We have, in consequence, a society of thinly
veneered predatoriness. And this, I believe, is why our
society is quite as unstable to-day as the Church itself.
They are both awakening to a new truth&mdash;which is <i>not</i>
separation.</p>

<p>The man who is proud of our Christian civilisation has
ideals susceptible of immense elevation. Christianity
has more souls in its hell and fewer in its heaven than any
other religion whatsoever. Naturally, Christian society is
one of extremes and of gross injustice&mdash;of oppression and
indifference to suffering. And so it will be until this materialism
of separation is repudiated: until we turn seriously
to the belief that men are truly brothers, not one of whom
can be long happy while any other suffers.</p>

<p>Come, Grandad, let us give up this God of Moses. Doubtless
he was good enough for the early Jews, but man has
always had to make God in his own image, and you and I
need a better one, for we both surpass this one in all spiritual
values&mdash;in love, in truth, in justice, in common decency&mdash;as
much as Jesus surpassed the unrepentant thief at his side.
Remember that an honest, fearless search for truth has led
to all the progress we can measure over the brutes. Why
must it lose the soul?</p>

<p>BERNAL.</p>

<p>(From the Reverend Allan Delcher to Bernal Linford.)</p>

<p>My boy, I shall not believe you are sane until I have seen
you face to face. I cannot believe you have fallen a victim
to Universalism, which is like the vale of Siddim, full of
slime-pits. I am an old man, and my mind goes haltingly,
yet that is what I seem to glean from your rambling screed.
Come when you are through, for I must see you once more.</p>

<p>&quot;For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through him might be saved. He
that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth
not is condemned already because he hath not believed in
the name of the only begotten son of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Lastly&mdash;doubt in infinite things is often wise, but doubt
of God must be blasphemy, else he would not be God, the
all-perfect.</p>

<p>I pray it may be your mind is still sick&mdash;and recall to you
these words of one I will not now name to you: &quot;Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">&quot;Is the Hand of the Lord Waxed Short?&quot;</h3>

<p>A dismayed old man, eagerly trying to feel incredulous,
awaited the home-coming of his grandsons at the
beginning of that vacation.</p>

<p>Was the hand of the Lord waxed short, that so utter
a blasphemer&mdash;unless, indeed, he were possessed of a
devil&mdash;could walk in the eye of Jehovah, and no breach
be made upon him? Even was the world itself so lax
in these days that one speaking thus could go free? If
so, then how could God longer refrain from drowning
the world again? The human baseness of the blaspheming
one and the divine toleration that permitted
it were alike incredible.</p>

<p>A score of times the old man nerved himself to laugh
away his fears. It could not be. The young mind was
still disordered.</p>

<p>On the night of the home-coming he greeted the
youth quite as if all were serene within him, determined
to be in no haste and to approach the thing lightly on
the morrow&mdash;in the fond hope that a mere breath of
authority might blow it away.</p>

<p>And when, the next morning, they both drifted to the
study, the old man called up the smile that made his
wrinkles sunny, and said in light tones, above the beating
of an anxious heart:</p>

<p>&quot;So it's your theory, boy, that we must all be taken
down with typhoid before we can be really wise in matters
of faith?&quot;</p>

<p>But the youth answered, quite earnestly:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir; I really believe nothing less than that would
clear most minds&mdash;especially old ones. You see, the
brain is a muscle and thought is its physical exercise.
It learns certain thoughts&mdash;to go through certain exercises.
These become a habit, and in time the muscle
becomes stiff and incapable of learning any new movements
&mdash;also incapable of leaving off the old. The
religion of an old person is merely so much reflex
nervous action. It is beyond the reach of reason. The
individual's mind can affect it as little as it can teach
the other muscles of his body new suppleness.&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with a certain restrained nervousness that
was not reassuring. But the old man would not yet
be rebuffed from his manner of lightness.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, wanting an epidemic of typhoid, we of the
older generation must die in error.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir&mdash;I doubt even the efficacy of typhoid in
most cases; it's as difficult for an old person to change
a habit of thought as to take the wrinkles from his face.
That is why what we very grandly call 'fighting for the
truth' or 'fighting for the Lord' is merely fighting for
our own little notions; they have become so vital to us
and we call them 'truth.'&quot;</p>

<p>The youth stopped, with a palpable air of defiance,
before which the old man's assumption of ease and
lightness was at last beaten down. He had been standing
erect by the table, still with the smile toning his
haggardness. Now the smile died; the whole man
sickened, lost life visibly, as if a dozen years of normal
aging were condensed into the dozen seconds.</p>

<p>He let himself go into the big chair, almost as if
falling, his head bowed, his eyes dulled to a look of
absence, his arms falling weakly over the chair's sides.
A sigh that was almost a groan seemed to tell of pain
both in body and mind.</p>

<p>Bernal stood awkwardly regarding him, then his
face lighted with a sudden pity.</p>

<p>&quot;But I thought <i>you</i> could understand, sir; I thought
you were different; you have been like a chum to me.
When I spoke of old persons it never occurred to me
that you could fall into that class! I never knew you
to be unjust, or unkind, or&mdash;narrow&mdash;perhaps I should
say, unsympathetic.&quot;</p>

<p>The other gave no sign of hearing.</p>

<p>&quot;My body was breaking so fast&mdash;and you break my
heart!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There you are, sir,&quot; began the youth, a little excitedly.
&quot;Your heart is breaking <i>not</i> because I'm not
good, but because I form a different opinion from yours
of a man rising from the dead, after he has been
crucified to appease the anger of his father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God help me! I'm so human. I <i>can't</i> feel toward
you as I should. Boy, I <i>won't</i> believe you are sane.&quot;
He looked up in a sudden passion of hope. &quot;I won't
believe Christ died in vain for my girl's little boy. Bernal, boy,
you are still sick of that fever!&quot;</p>

<p>The other smiled, his youthful scorn for the moment
overcoming his deeper feeling for his listener.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I must talk more. Now, sir, for God's sake
let us have the plain truth of the crucifixion. Where
was the sacrifice? Can you not picture the mob that
would fight for the honour of crucifixion to-morrow,
if it were known that the one chosen would sit at the
right hand of God and judge all the world? I say
there was no sacrifice, even if Christian dogma be literal
truth. Why, sir, I could go into the street and find ten
men in ten minutes who would be crucified a hundred
times to save the souls of us from hell&mdash;<i>not</i> if they were
to be rewarded with a seat on the throne of God where
they could send into hell those who did not believe in
them&mdash;but for no reward whatever&mdash;out of a sheer love
for humanity. Don't you see, sir, that we have magnified
that crucifixion out of all proportion to the plainest
truth of our lives? You know I would die on a cross
to-day, not to redeem the world, but to redeem one poor
soul&mdash;your own. If you deny that, at least you won't
dare deny that you would go on the cross to redeem <i>my</i>
soul from hell&mdash;the soul of one man&mdash;and do you think
you would demand a reward for doing it, beyond knowing
that you had ransomed me from torment? Would
it be necessary to your happiness that you also have
the power to send into hell all those who were not able
to believe you had actually died for me?</p>

<p>&quot;One moment more, sir&mdash;&quot; The thin, brown,
old hand had been raised in trembling appeal, while
the lips moved without sound.</p>

<p>&quot;You see every day in the papers how men die for
other men, for one man, for two, a dozen! Why, sir,
you know you would die to save the lives of five little
children&mdash;their bare carnal lives, mind you, to say nothing
of their immortal souls. I believe I'd die myself to
save two thousand&mdash;I <i>know</i> I would to save three&mdash;if
their faces were clean and they looked funny enough
and helpless. Here, in this morning's paper, a negro
labourer, going home from his work in New York
yesterday, pushed into safety one of those babies that
are always crawling around on railroad tracks. He
had time to see that he could get the baby off but not
himself, and then he went ahead. Doubtless it was a
very common baby, and certainly he was a very common
man. Why, I could go down to Sing Sing to-morrow,
and I'll stake my own soul that in the whole
cageful of criminals there isn't one who would not
eagerly submit to crucifixion if he believed that he
would thereby ransom the race from hell. And he
wouldn't want the power to damn the unbelievers,
either. He would insist upon saving them with the
others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, God, forgive this insane passion in my boy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was passion, sir&mdash;&quot; he spoke with a sudden
relenting&mdash;&quot;but try to remember that I've sought the
truth honestly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You degrade the Saviour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; I only raise man out of the muck of Christian
belief about him. If common men all might live lives
of greater sacrifice than Jesus did, without any pretensions
to the supernatural, it only means that we
need a new embodiment for our ideals. If we find it
in man&mdash;in God's creature&mdash;so much the better for man
and so much the more glory to God, who has not then
bungled so wretchedly as Christianity teaches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God forgive you this tirade&mdash;I know it is the sickness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall try to speak calmly, sir&mdash;but how much
longer can an educated clergy keep a straight face to
speak of this wretchedly impotent God? Christians
of a truth have had to bind their sense of humour as
the Chinese bound their women's feet. But the laugh
is gathering even now. Your religion is like a tree
that has lain long dead in the forest&mdash;firm wood to the
eye but dust to the first blow. And this is how it will
go&mdash;from a laugh&mdash;not through the solemn absurdities
of the so-called higher criticism, the discussing of this
or that miracle, the tracing of this or that myth of fall
or deluge or immaculate conception or trinity to its
pagan sources; not that way, when before the inquiring
mind rises the sheer materialism of the Christian dogma,
bristling with absurdities&mdash;its vain bungling God of one
tribe who crowns his career of impotencies&mdash;in all but
the art of slaughter&mdash;by instituting the sacrifice of a Son
begotten of a human mother, to appease his wrath
toward his own creatures; a God who even by this
pitiful device can save but a few of us. Was ever god
so powerless? Do you think we who grow up now do
not detect it? Is it not time to demand a God of
virtue, of integrity, of ethical dignity&mdash;a religion whose
test shall be moral, and not the opinion one forms of
certain alleged material phenomena?&quot;</p>

<p>When he had first spoken the old man cowered low
and lower in his chair, with little moans of protest at
intervals, perhaps a quick, almost gasping, &quot;God
forgive him!&quot; or a &quot;Lord have mercy!&quot; But as the
talk went on he became slowly quieter, his face grew
firmer, he sat up in his chair, and at the last he came to
bend upon the speaker a look that made him falter
confusedly and stop.</p>

<p>&quot;I can say no more, sir; I should not have said so
much. Oh, Grandad, I wouldn't have hurt you for
all the world, yet I had to let you know why I could
not do what you had planned&mdash;and I was fool enough
to think I could justify myself to you!&quot;</p>

<p>The old eyes still blazed upon him with a look
of sorrow and of horror that was yet, first of all,
a look of power; the look of one who had mastered
himself to speak calmly while enduring uttermost
pain.</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad you have spoken. You were honest to
do so. It was my error not to be convinced at first,
and thus save myself a shock I could ill bear. But
you have been sick, and I felt that I should not believe
without seeing you. I had built so much&mdash;so many
years&mdash;on your preaching the gospel of&mdash;of my Saviour.
This hope has been all my life these last years&mdash;now it
is gone. But I have no right to complain. You are
free; I have no claim upon you; and I shall be glad to
provide for you&mdash;to educate you further for any profession
you may have chosen&mdash;to start you in any
business&mdash;away from here&mdash;from this house&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The young man flushed&mdash;wincing under this, but
answered:</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, sir. I could hardly take anything
further. I don't know what I want to do, what I can
do&mdash;I'm at sea now. But I will go. I'm sure only
that I want to get out&mdash;away&mdash;I will take a small sum
to go with&mdash;I know you would be hurt more if I didn't;
enough to get me away&mdash;far enough away.&quot;</p>

<p>He went out, his head bowed under the old man's
stern gaze. But when the latter had stepped to the
door and locked it, his fortitude was gone. Helplessly
he fell upon his knees before the big chair&mdash;praying out
his grief in hard, dry sobs that choked and shook his
worn body.</p>

<p>When Clytie knocked at the door an hour later, he
was dry-eyed and apparently serene, but busy with
papers at his table.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it something bad about Bernal, Mr. Delcher,&quot;
she asked, &quot;that he's going away so queer and sudden?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>You</i> pray for him, too, Clytie&mdash;you love him&mdash;but
it's nothing to talk of.&quot;</p>

<p>But the alarm of Clytemnestra was not to be put
down by this.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Mr. Delcher&mdash;&quot; a look of horror grew big
in her eyes&mdash;&quot;You don't mean to say he's gone and
joined the Universalists?&quot;</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;And he ain't a <i>Unitarian</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Clytie; but our boy has been to college and it
has left him rather un&mdash;unconforming in some little
matters&mdash;some details&mdash;doubtless his doctrine is sound
at core.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I supposed he'd learn everything off at that
college, only I know he never got fed half enough.
What with all its studies and football and clubs and
things I thought it was as good as a liberal education.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too liberal, sometimes! Pray for Bernal&mdash;and we
won't talk about it again, Clytie, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p>Presently came Allan, who had heard the news.</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal tells me he will not enter the ministry, sir;
that he is going away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have decided that is best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know, sir, I have suspected for some time that
Bernal was not as sound doctrinally as you could wish.
His mind, if I may say it, is a peculiarly literal one.
He seems to lack a certain spiritual comprehensiveness
&mdash;an enveloping intuition, so to say, of the spiritual
value in a material fact. During that unhappy agitation
for the revision of our creed, I have heard him,
touching the future state of unbaptised infants, utter
sentiments of a heterodoxy that was positively effeminate
in its sentimentality&mdash;sentiments which I shall
not pain you by repeating. He has often referred,
moreover, with the same disordered sentimentality, to
the sad fate of our father&mdash;about whose present estate
no churchman can have any doubt. And then about
our belief that even good works are an abomination
before God if performed by the unregenerate, the
things I have heard him&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;let us not talk of it further. Did you
wish to see me especially, Allan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes, sir, I <i>had</i> wished to, and perhaps now is
the best moment. I wanted to ask you, sir, how you
would regard my becoming an Episcopalian. I am
really persuaded that its form of worship, translating
as it does so <i>much</i> of the spiritual verity of life into
visible symbols, is a form better calculated than the
Presbyterian to appeal to the great throbbing heart of
humanity. I hope I may even say, without offense, sir,
that it affords a wider scope, a broader sweep, a more
stimulating field of endeavour, to one who may have a
capacity for the life of larger aspects. In short, sir, I
believe there is a great future for me in that church.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shouldn't wonder if there was,&quot; answered the
old man, who had studied his face closely during the
speech. Yet he spoke with an extreme dryness of tone
that made the other look quickly up.</p>

<p>&quot;It shall be as you wish,&quot; he continued, after a meditative
pause&mdash;&quot;I believe you are better calculated for
that church than for mine. Obey your call.&quot;</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">In the Folly of His Youth</h3>

<p>At early twilight Bernal, sore at heart for the pain
he had been obliged to cause the old man, went to the
study-door for a last word with him.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe there is no one above whose forgiveness I
need, sir&mdash;but I shall always be grieved if I can't have
yours. I <i>do</i> need that.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man had stood by the open door as if meaning
to cut short the interview.</p>

<p>&quot;You have it. I forgive you any hurt you have done
me; it was due quite as much to my limitations as to
yours. For that other forgiveness, which you will one
day know is more than mine&mdash;I&mdash;I shall always pray
for that.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped, and the other waited awkwardly, his
heart rushing out in ineffectual flood against the old
man's barrier of stern restraint. For a moment he made
folds in his soft hat with a fastidious precision. Finally
he nerved himself to say calmly:</p>

<p>&quot;I thank you, sir, for all you have done&mdash;all you
have ever done for me and for Allan&mdash;and, good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>Though there was no hint of unkindness in the old
man's voice, something formal in his manner had
restrained the other from offering his hand. Still loath
to go without it, he said again more warmly:</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>This time he turned and went slowly down the dim
hall, still making the careful folds in his hat, as if he
might presently recall something that would take him
back. At the foot of the stairs he stopped quickly to
listen, believing he had heard a call from above; but
nothing came and he went out. Still in the door upstairs
was the old man&mdash;stern of face, save that far
back in his eyes a kind spirit seemed to strive ineffectually.</p>

<p>Across the lawn from her hammock Nancy called to
Bernal. He went slowly toward her, still suffering
from the old man's coldness&mdash;and for the hurts he had
unwittingly put upon him.</p>

<p>The girl, as he went forward, stood to greet him,
her gown, sleeveless, neckless, taking the bluish tinge
that early twilight gives to snow, a tinge that deepened to
dusk about her eyes and in her hair. She gave him her
hand and at once he felt a balm poured into his tortured
heart. After all, men were born to hurt and be hurt.</p>

<p>He sat in the rustic chair opposite the hammock,
looking into Nancy's black-lashed eyes of the Irish gray,
noting that from nineteen to twenty her neck had
broadened at the base the least one might discern, that
her face was less full yet richer in suggestion&mdash;her face
of the odds and ends when she did not smile. At this
moment she was not only unsmiling, but excited.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Bernal, what is it? Tell me quick. Allan
was so vague&mdash;though he said he'd always stand by
you, no matter what you did. What <i>have</i> you done,
Bernal? Is it a college scrape?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's only Allan's big-hearted way of talking!
He's so generous and loyal I think he's often been disappointed
that I didn't do something, so he <i>could</i> stand
by me. No&mdash;no scrapes, Nance, honour bright!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you're leaving&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, in a way I have done something. I've found
I couldn't be a minister as Grandad had set his heart on
my being&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if you haven't done anything wicked, why
not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm not a believer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In anything, I think&mdash;except, well, in you and
Grandad and&mdash;and Allan and Clytie&mdash;yes, and in myself,
Nance. That's a big point. I believe in myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you're going because you don't believe in other
things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, or because I believe too much&mdash;just as you
like to put it. I demanded a better God of Grandad,
Nance&mdash;one that didn't create hell and men like me to
fill it just for the sake of scaring a few timid mortals
into heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know Aunt Bell is an unbeliever. She says no
one with an open mind can live twenty years in Boston
without being vastly broadened&mdash;'broadening into the
higher unbelief,' she calls it. She says she has passed
through nearly every stage of unbelief there is, but that
she feels the Lord is going to bring her back at last
to rest in the shadow of the Cross.&quot;</p>

<p>As Aunt Bell could be heard creaking heavily in a
willow rocker on the piazza near-by, the young man
suppressed a comment that arose within him.</p>

<p>&quot;Only, unbelievers are apt to be fatiguing&quot; the girl
continued, in a lower tone. &quot;You know Aunt Bell's
husband, Uncle Chester&mdash;the meekest, dearest little
man in the world, he was&mdash;well, once he disappeared
and wasn't heard of again for over four years&mdash;except
that they knew his bank account was drawn on from
time to time. Then, at last, his brother found him,
living quietly under an assumed name in a little town
outside of Boston&mdash;pretending that he hadn't a relative
in the world. He told his brother he was just beginning
to feel rested. Aunt Bell said he was demented.
While he was away she'd been all through psychometry,
the planchette, clairvoyance, palmistry, astrology, and
Unitarianism. What are you, Bernal?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, Nance&mdash;that's the trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But where are you going, and what for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know either answer&mdash;but I can't stay here,
because I'm blasphemous&mdash;it seems&mdash;and I don't
want to stay, even if I weren't sent. I want to be out&mdash;
away. I feel as if I must be looking for something I
haven't found. I suspect it's a fourth dimension to
religion. They have three&mdash;even breadth&mdash;but they
haven't found faith yet&mdash;a faith that doesn't demand
arbitrary signs, parlour-magic, and bloody, weird tales
in a book that becomes their idol.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl looked at him long in silence, swaying a
little in the hammock, a bare elbow in one hand, her
meditative chin in the other, the curtains of her eyes
half-drawn, as if to let him in a little at a time before
her wonder. Then, at last:</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you're another Adam&mdash;being sent out of the
garden for your sin. Now tell me&mdash;honest&mdash;was the
sin worth it? I've often wondered.&quot; She gave an eager
little laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Nance, it's worth so much that you want to
go of your own accord. Do you suppose Adam could
have stayed in that fat, lazy, silly garden after he
became alive&mdash;with no work, no knowledge, no adventure,
no chance to do wrong? As for earning his
bread&mdash;the only plausible hell I've ever been able to
picture is one where there was nothing to do&mdash;no work,
no puzzling, no chances to take, no necessity of thinking.
Now, isn't that an ideal hell? And is it my fault if it
happens to be a description of what Christians look
forward to as heaven? I tell you, Adam would have
gone out of that garden from sheer boredom after a few
days. The setting of the angel with the flaming sword
to guard the gate shows that God still failed to understand
the wonderful creature he had made.&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled, meditative, wondering.</p>

<p>&quot;I dare say, for my part, I'd have eaten that apple
if the serpent had been at all persuasive. Bernal, I
wonder&mdash;and wonder&mdash;and wonder&mdash;I'm never done.
And Aunt Bell says I'll never be a sweet and wholesome
and stimulating companion to my husband, if I don't
stop being so vague and fantastic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What does she call being vague and fantastic?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not wanting any husband.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal, it's like the time that you ran off when you
were a wee thing&mdash;to be bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you cried because I wouldn't take you with
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can feel the woe of it yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're dry-eyed now, Nance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;and the pink parasol and the buff shoes I
meant to take with me are also things of the past.
Mercy! The idea of going off with an unbeliever to
be bad and&mdash;everything! 'The happy couple are
said to look forward to a life of joyous wickedness,
several interesting crimes having been planned for the
coming season. For their honeymoon infamy they
will perpetrate a series of bank-robberies along the
Maine coast.' There&mdash;how would that sound?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're right, Nance&mdash;I wouldn't take you this
time either, even if you cried. And your little speech
is funny and all that&mdash;but Nance, I believe, these
last years, we've both thought of things now and then&mdash;
things, you know&mdash;things to think of and not talk of&mdash;
and see here&mdash;The man was driven out of the
garden&mdash;but not the woman. She isn't mentioned.
She could stay there&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Until she got tired of it herself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Until the man came back for her.&quot;</p>

<p>He thought her face was glowing duskily in the
twilight.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder&mdash;wonder about so many things,&quot; she
said softly.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you're a sleeping rebel yourself, Nance.
If ever you do eat from that tree, there'll be no holding
you. You won't wait to be driven forth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you are, a wicked young man&mdash;that kind
never comes back in the stories.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That may be no jest, Nance. I should surely be
wicked, if I thought it brings the happiness it's said to.
Under this big sky I am free from any moral law that
doesn't come from right here inside me. Can you
realize that? Do I seem bad for saying it? What
they call the laws of God are nothing. I suspect them
all, and I'll make every one of them find its authority
in me before I obey it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It sounds&mdash;well&mdash;unpromising, Bernal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you it was serious, Nance. I see but one
law clearly&mdash;I am bound to want happiness. Every
man is bound always to want happiness, Nance. No
man can possibly want anything else. That's the only
thing under heaven I'm sure of at this moment&mdash;the
one universal law under which we all make our
mistakes&mdash;good people and bad alike?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Bernal, you wouldn't be bad&mdash;not really bad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Nance, I've a vague, loose sort of notion that
one isn't really compelled to be bad in order to be
happy right here on earth. I know the Church rather
intimates this, but I suspect that vice is not the delicious
thing the Church implies it to be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You make me afraid, Bernal&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if I do come back, Nance, having toiled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;and you make me wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think that's all either of us can do, Nance, and I
must go. I have to say good-bye to Clytie yet. The
poor soul is convinced that I have become a Unitarian
and that there's a conspiracy to keep the horrible truth
from her. She says grandad evaded her questions
about it. She doesn't dream there are depths below
Unitarianism. I must try to convince her that I'm not
<i>that</i> bad&mdash;that I may have a weak head and a defective
heart, but not that. Nance&mdash;girl!&quot;</p>

<p>He sat forward in the chair, reaching toward her.
She turned her face away, but their hands trembled
toward each other, faltering fearfully, tremulously,
into a clasp that became at once firm and knowing when
it felt itself&mdash;as if it opened their blind eyes to a world
of life and light without end, a world in which they two
were the first to live.</p>

<p>Lingeringly, with slow, regretting fingers, the hands
fell apart, to tighten eagerly again into the clasp that
made them one flesh.</p>

<p>When at last they were put asunder both arose. The
girl patted from her skirts the hammock's little disarranging
touches, while the youth again made the careful
folds in his hat. Then they shook hands very stiffly,
and went opposite ways out of a formal garden of
farewell; the youth to sate that beautiful, crude young
lust for living&mdash;too fierce to be tamed save by its own
failures, hearing only the sagas of action, of form and
colour and sound made one by heat&mdash;the song Nature
sings unendingly&mdash;but heard only by young ears.</p>

<p>The girl went back to the Crealock piazza to hear of
one better set in the grace of faith.</p>

<p>&quot;That elder young Linford,&quot; began Aunt Bell,
ceasing to rock, &quot;has a future. You know I talked
to him about the Episcopal Church, strongly advising
him to enter it. For all my broad views&quot;&mdash;Aunt Bell
sighed here&mdash;&quot;I really and truly believe, child, that no
one not an Episcopalian is ever thoroughly at ease
in this world.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell was beautifully, girlishly plump, with a
sophisticated air of smartness&mdash;of coquetry, indeed&mdash;as
to her exquisitely small hands and feet; and though a
certain suggestion of melancholy in her tone harmonised
with the carefully dressed gray hair and with her
apparent years, she nevertheless breathed airs of perfect
comfort.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course this young chap could see at once,&quot; she
went on, &quot;what immensely better form it is than Calvinism.
<i>Dear</i> me! Imagine one being a Presbyterian
in this day!&quot; It seemed here that the soul of
Aunt Bell poised a disdainful lorgnette before its eyes,
through which to survey in a fitting manner the unmodish
spectacle of Calvinism.</p>

<p>&quot;And he tells me that he has his grandfather's consent.
Really, my dear, with his physique and voice and
manner that fellow undoubtedly has a future in the
Episcopal Church. I dare say he'll be wearing the
lawn sleeves and rochet of a bishop before he's forty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did it ever occur to you, Aunt Bell, that he is&mdash;well,
just the least trifle&mdash;I was going to say, vain of his
appearance&mdash;but I'll make it 'self-conscious'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Child, don't you know that a young man, really
beautiful without being effeminate, is bound to be conscious
of it. But vain he is not. It mortifies him
dreadfully, though he pretends to make light of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why speak of it so often? He was telling me
to-day of an elderly Englishman who addressed him on
the train, telling him what a striking resemblance he
bore to the Prince of Wales when he was a youth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so; and he told me yesterday of hearing a
lady in the drug-store ask the clerk who 'that handsome
stranger' was. But, my dear, he tells them as jokes
on himself, and he's so sheepish about it. And he's
such a splendid orator. I persuaded him to-day to
read me one of his college papers. I don't seem to
recall much of the substance, but it was full of the most
beautiful expressions. One, I remember, begins, 'Oh,
of all the flowers that swing their golden censers in the
parterre of the human heart, none so rich, so rare as
this one flower of&mdash;' you know I've forgotten what it
was&mdash;Civilisation or Truth or something. Anyway,
whatever it was, it had like a giant engine rolled the
car of Civilisation out from the maze of antiquity, where
she now waits to be freighted with the precious fruits
of living genius, and so on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That seems impressive and&mdash;mixed, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I can't remember things in their order,
but it was about the essential nature of man being
gregarious, and truth is a potent factor in civilisation,
and something would be a tear on the world's cold
cheek to make it burn forever&mdash;isn't that striking?
And Greece had her Athens and her Corinth, but
where now is Greece with her proud cities? And
Rome, Imperial Rome, with all her pomp and splendour.
Of course I can't recall his words. There was a beautiful
reference to America, I remember, from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, from the lakes of the frozen
North to the ever-tepid waters of the sunny South&mdash;and
a perfectly splendid passage about the world is and ever
has been illiberal. Witness the lonely lamp of Erasmus,
the cell of Galileo, the dying bed of Pascal, the scaffold
of Sidney&mdash;Sidney who, I wonder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has it taken you that way, Aunt Bell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And France, the saddest example of a nation without
a God, and succeeding generations will only add
a new lustre to our present resplendent glory, bound
together by the most sacred ties of goodwill; independent,
yet acknowledging the sovereignty of Omnipotence,
and it was fraught with vital interest to every thinking
man&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spare me, Aunt Bell&mdash;it's like Coney Island, with
all those carrousels going around and five bands playing
at once!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But his peroration! I can't pretend to give you
any idea of its beauties&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get him to declaim it for you. It begins in the
most impressive language about his standing on top of
the Rocky Mountains one day and placing his feet
upon a solid rock, he saw a tempest gathering in the
valley far below. So he watches the storm&mdash;in his own
language, of course&mdash;while all around him is sunshine.
And such should be our aim in life, to plant our feet
on the solid rock of&mdash;how provoking! I can't remember
what the rock was&mdash;anyway, we are to bid those
in the valley below to cease their bickerings and come
up to the rock&mdash;I think it was Intellectual Greatness&mdash;
No!&mdash;Unselfishness&mdash;that's it. And the title of the
paper was a sermon in itself&mdash;'The Temporal Advantage
of the Individual No Norm of Morality.' Isn't
that a beautiful thought in itself? Nancy, that chap
will waste himself until he has a city parish.&quot;</p>

<p>There was silence for a little time before Aunt Bell
asked, as one having returned to baser matters:</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if the jacket of my gray suit came back
from that clumsy tailor. I forgot to ask Ellen if an
express package came.&quot;</p>

<p>And Nancy, whose look was bent far into the dusk,
answered:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I wonder if he will come back!&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Perverse Behaviour of an Old Man and a Young Man</h3>

<p>When old Allan Delcher slept with his fathers&mdash;
being so found in the big chair, with the worn, leather-bound
Bible open in his lap&mdash;the revived but still tender
faith of Aunt Bell Hardwick was bitten as by frost.
And this though the Bible had lain open at that psalm
in which David is said to describe the corruption of a
natural man&mdash;a psalm beginning, &quot;The fool hath said
in his heart, 'There is no God.'&quot;</p>

<p>For it straightway appeared that the dead man had
in life done abperverse and inexplicable thing, to the
bitter amazement of those who had learned to trust
him. On the day after he sent a blasphemous grandson
from his door he had called for Squire Cumpston,
announcing to the family his intention to make an entirely
new will&mdash;a thing for which there seemed to be a
certain sad necessity.</p>

<p>When he could no longer be reproached it transpired
that he had left &quot;to Allan Delcher Linford, son of one
Clayton Linford,&quot; a beggarly pittance of five thousand
dollars; and &quot;to my beloved grandson, Bernal Linford,
I give, devise and bequeath the residue of my estate,
both real and personal.&quot;</p>

<p>Though the husband of her niece wore publicly a
look of faith unimpaired, and was thereby an example
to her, Aunt Bell declared herself to be once more on
the verge of believing that the proofs of an overseeing
Providence, all-wise and all-loving, were by no means
overwhelming; that they were, indeed, of so frail a
validity that she could not wonder at people falling
away from the Church. It was a trying time for Aunt
Bell. She felt that her return to the shadow of the
cross was not being made enough of by the One above.
After years of running after strange gods, the Episcopal
service as administered by Allan had prevailed over her
seasoned skepticism: through its fascinating leaven of
romance&mdash;with faint and, as it seemed to her, wholly
reverent hints of physical culture&mdash;the spirit may be
said to have blandished her. And now this turpitude
in a man of God came to disturb the first tender rootlings
of her new faith.</p>

<p>The husband of her niece had loyally endeavoured
to dissuade her from this too human reaction.</p>

<p>&quot;God has chosen to try me for a purpose, Aunt Bell,&quot;
he said very simply. &quot;I ought to be proud of it&mdash;
eager for any test&mdash;and I am. True, in these last years
I had looked upon grandfather's fortune as mine&mdash;
not only by implied promise, but by all standards of
right&mdash;even of integrity. For surely a man could not
more nearly forfeit his own rights, in every moral aspect,
than poor Bernal has&mdash;though I meant always to stand
by him. So you see, I must conclude that God means
to distinguish me by a test. He may even subject me
to others; but I shall not wince. I shall welcome His
trials. He turned upon her the face of simple faith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you speak to that lawyer about the possibility
of a contest&mdash;of proving unsound mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did, but he saw no chance whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell hereupon surveyed her beautifully dimpled
knuckles minutely, with an affectionate pride&mdash;a pride
not uncritical, yet wholly convinced.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; added Allan after a moment's reflection,
&quot;there's no sense in believing that every bit of one's
hard luck is sent by God to test one. One must in all
reverence take every precaution to prove that the disaster
is not humanly remediable. And this, I may say,
I have done with thoroughness&mdash;with great thoroughness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal may be dead,&quot; suggested Aunt Bell, brightening
now from an impartial admiring of the toes of her
small, plump slippers.</p>

<p>&quot;God forbid that he should be cut off in his unbelief
&mdash;but then, God's will be done. If that be
true, of course, the matter is different. Meantime we
are advertising.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I had your superb faith, Allan. I wish
Nancy had it....&quot;</p>

<p>Her niece's husband turned his head and shoulders
until she had the three-quarters view of his face.</p>

<p>&quot;I have faith, Aunt Bell. God knows my unworthiness,
even as you know it and I know it&mdash;but I have
faith!&quot;</p>

<p>The golden specks in his hazel eyes blazed with
humility, and a flush of the same virtue mantled his
perfect brow.</p>

<p>Such news of Bernal Linford as had come back to
Edom, though meagre and fragmentary, was of a character
to confirm the worst fears of those who loved him.
The first report came within a year after his going, and
caused a shaking of many heads.</p>

<p>An estimable farmer, one Caleb Webster, living on
the outskirts of Edom, had, in a blameless spirit of
adventure, toured the Far West, at excursion rates
said to be astounding for cheapness. He had met the
unfortunate young man in one of the newer mining
towns along his exciting route.</p>

<p>&quot;He was kind of nursin' a feller that had the consumption,
&quot; ran the gossip of Mr. Webster, &quot;some one
he'd fell in with out in them parts, that had gone there
to git cured. But, High Mighty! the way them two
carried on at all hours wasn't goin' to cure no one of
nothin'! Specially gamblin', which was done right in
public, you might say, though the sharpers never
skinned me none, I'll say that! But these two was at it
every night, and finally they done just like I told the
young fools they'd do&mdash;they lost all they had. They
come into the Commercial House one night where I was
settin' lookin' over a time-table, both seemin' down in
the mouth. And all to once this sick young man&mdash;Mr.
Hoover, his name was&mdash;bust out cryin'&mdash;him bein'
weak or mebbe in liquor or somethin'.</p>

<p>&quot;'Every cent lost!' he says, the tears runnin' down
those yellow, sunk cheeks of his. But Bernal seems to
git chipper again when he sees how Mr. Hoover is takin'
it, so he says, 'Haven't you got a cent left, Hoover?
Haven't you got anythin' at all left? Just think,' he
says, 'what I stood to win on that last turn, if it'd come
my way&mdash;at four to one,' he says, or somethin' like
that; them gamblin' terms is too much for me. 'Hain't
you got nothin' at all left?' he says.</p>

<p>&quot;Then this Hoover&mdash;still cryin', mind you&mdash;he says,
'Not a cent in the world except forty dollars in my trunk
upstairs that I saved out to bury me with&mdash;and they
won't send me another cent,' he says, 'because I tried
'em.'</p>

<p>&quot;It sounded awful to hear him talkin' like that about
his own buryin', but it didn't phase Bernal none.</p>

<p>&quot;'Forty dollars!' he says, kind of sniffy like. 'Why,
man, what could you do for forty dollars? Don't you
know such things are very outrageous in price here?
Forty <i>dollars</i>&mdash;why,' he says, 'the very best you could
do would be one of these plain pine things with black
cloth tacked on to it, and pewter trimmin's if <i>any</i>,' he
says. 'Think of <i>pewter</i> trimmin's!'</p>

<p>&quot;'Say,' he says, when Hoover begun to look up at
him, 'you run and dig up your old forty and I'll go back
right now and win you out a full satin-lined, silver-trimmed
one, polished mahogany and gold name-plate,
and there'll be enough for a clock of immortelles with the
hands stopped at just the hour it happens,' he says.
'And you want to hurry,' he says, 'it ought to be done
right away&mdash;with that cough of yours.'</p>

<p>&quot;Me? Gosh, I felt awful&mdash;I wanted to drop right
through the floor, but this Hoover, he says all at once,
still snufflin', mind you: 'Say, that's all right,' he says.
'If I'm goin' to do it at all, I ought to do it right for the
credit of my folks. I ought to give this town a flash of
the right thing,' he says.</p>

<p>&quot;Then he goes upstairs, leaning on the balusters, and
gets his four ten-dollar bills that had been folded away
all neat at the bottom of his trunk, and before I could
think of anythin' wholesome to say&mdash;I was that scandalised
&mdash;they was goin' off across the street to the
Horseshoe Gamin' Parlour, this feller Hoover seemin'
very sanguine and asking Bernal whether he was sure
they was a party in town could do it up right after they'd
went and won the money for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir, I jest set there thinkin' how this boy Bernal
Linford was brought up for a preacher, and 'Jest
look at him now!' I says to myself&mdash;and I guess it was
mebbe an hour later I seen 'em comin' out of the
swingin' blinds in the door of this place, and a laffin'
fit to kill themselves. 'High Mighty! they done it!' I
says, watchin' 'em laff and slap each other on the back
till Hoover had to stop in the middle of the street to
cough. Well, they come into the Commercial office
where I am and I says, 'Well, boys, how much did you
fellers win?' and Hoover says, 'Not a cent! We lost
our roll,' he says. 'It's the blamedest funniest thing I
ever heard of,' he says, just like that, laffin' again fit
to choke.</p>

<p>&quot;'<i>I</i> don't see anythin' to laff at,' I says. 'How you
goin' to live?'</p>

<p>&quot;'How's he goin' to die?' says Bernal, 'without a
cent to do it on?'</p>

<p>&quot;'That's the funny part of it,' says Hoover. 'Linford
thought of it first. How <i>can</i> I die now? It
wouldn't be square,' he says&mdash;'me without a cent!'</p>

<p>&quot;Then they both began to laugh&mdash;but me, I couldn't
see nothin' funny about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Wal, I left early next mornin', not wantin' to have
to refuse 'em a loan.&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">How a Brother was Different</h3>

<p>In contrast with this regrettable performance of Bernal's,
which, alas! bore internal evidence of being a
type of many, was the flawless career of Allan, the dutiful
and earnest. Not only did he complete his course
at the General Theological Seminary with great honour,
but he was ordained into the Episcopal ministry under
circumstances entirely auspicious. Aunt Bell confided
to Nancy that his superior presence quite dwarfed
the bishop who ordained him.</p>

<p>His ordination sermon, moreover, which his grandfather
had been persuaded into journeying to hear, was
held by many to be a triumph of pulpit oratory no less
than an able yet not unpoetic handling of his text,
which was from John&mdash;&quot;The Truth shall make you
free.&quot;</p>

<p>Truth, he declared, was the crowning glory in
the diadem of man's attributes, and a subject fraught
with vital interest to every thinking man. The essential
nature of man being gregarious, how important that
the leader of men should hold Truth to be like a diamond,
made only the brighter by friction. The world is and
ever has been illiberal. Witness the lonely lamp of
Erasmus, the cell of Galileo, the dying bed of Pascal,
the scaffold of Sidney&mdash;all fighters for truth against the
masses who cannot think for themselves.</p>

<p>Truth was, indeed, a potent factor in civilisation. If
only all truth-lovers could feel bound together by the
sacred ties of fraternal good-will, independent yet
acknowledging the sovereignty of Omnipotence, succeeding
ages could but add a new lustre to their present
resplendent glory.</p>

<p>Truth, triumphant out of oppression, is a tear falling
on the world's cold cheek to make it burn forever. Why
fear the revelation of truth? Greece had her Athens
and her Corinth, but where is Greece to-day? Rome,
too, Imperial Rome, with all her pomp and polish!
They were, but they are not&mdash;for want of Truth. But
might not we hope for a land where Truth would reign
&mdash;from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the lakes of the
frozen North to the ever-tepid waters of the sunny
South?</p>

<p>Truth is the grand motor-power which, like a giant
engine, has rolled the car of civilisation out from the
maze of antiquity where it now waits to be freighted
with the precious fruits of living genius.</p>

<p>The young man's final flight was observed by Aunt
Bell to impress visibly even the bishop&mdash;a personage
whom she had begun to suspect was the least bit cynical,
perhaps from having listened to many first sermons.</p>

<p>&quot;Standing one day,&quot; it began, &quot;near the summit of
one of the grand old Rocky Mountains that in primeval
ages was elevated from ocean's depths and now towers
its snow-capped peak heavenward touching the azure
blue, I witnessed a scene which, for beauty of illustration
of the thought in hand, the world cannot surpass.
Placing my feet upon a solid rock, I saw, far down in
the valley below, the tempest gathering. Soon the low-muttered
thunder and vivid flashes of lightning gave
token of increasing turbulence with Nature's elements.
Thus the storm raged far below while all around me
and above glittered the pure sunlight of heaven, where
I mingled in the blue serene; until at last the thought
came electric-like, as half-divine, here is exemplified
in Nature's own impressive language the simple
grandeurs of Truth. While we are in the valley below,
we have ebullitions of discontent and murmurings of
strife; but as we near the summit of Truth our thought
becomes elevated. Then placing our feet on the
solid Rock of Ages, we call to those in the valley
below to cease their bickerings and come up
higher.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth! Oh, of all the flowers that swing their
golden censers in the parterre of the human heart, none
so rich, so rare, as this one flower of Truth. Other
flowers there may be that yield as rich perfume, but
they must be crushed in order that their fragrance
become perceptible. But the soul of this flower courses
its way down the garden walk, out through the deep,
dark dell, over the burning plain, up the mountain-side,
<i>up</i> and ever UP it rises into the beautiful blue; all along
the cloudy corridors of the day, <i>up</i> along the misty
pathway to the skies, till it touches the beautiful shore
and mingles with the breath of angels!&quot;</p>

<p>Yet a perverse old man had sat stonily under this sermon
&mdash;had, even after so effective a baptism, neglected
to undo that which he should never have done. Moreover,
even on the day of this notable sermon, he was
known to have referred to the young man, within the
hearing of a discreet housekeeper, as &quot;the son of his
father&quot;&mdash;which was an invidious circumlocution,
amounting almost to an epithet. And he had most
weakly continued to grieve for the wayward lost son of
his daughter&mdash;the godless boy whom he had driven
from his door.</p>

<p>Not even the other bit of news that came a little later
had sufficed to make him repair his injustice; and this,
though the report came by the Reverend Arthur Pelham
Gridley, incumbent of the Presbyterian pulpit at Edom,
who could preach sermons the old man liked.</p>

<p>Mr. Gridley, returning from a certain gathering of
the brethren at Denver, had brought this news: That
Bernal Linford had been last seen walking south from
Denver, like a common tramp, in the company of a
poor half-witted creature who had aroused some local
excitement by declaring himself to be the son of God,
speaking familiarly of the Deity as &quot;Father.&quot;</p>

<p>As this impious person had been of a very simple
mind and behaved inoffensively, rather shrinking from
publicity than courting it, he had at first attracted little
attention. It appeared, however, that he had presently
begun an absurd pretence of healing the sick and the
lame; and, like all charlatans, he so cunningly worked
upon the imaginations of his dupes that a remarkable
number of them believed that they actually had been
healed by him. In fact, the nuisance of his operations
had grown to an extent so alarming that thousands of
people stood in line from early morning until dusk
awaiting their turn to be blessed and &quot;healed&quot; by the
impostor. Just as several of the clergy, said Mr. Gridley,
were on the point of denouncing this creature as
anti-Christ and thus exploding his pretensions; and when
the city authorities, indeed, appealed to by the local
physicians, were on the point of suppressing him for
disorderly conduct, and a menace to the public health,
since he was encouraging the people to forsake their
family physicians; and just as the news came that a
long train-load of the variously suffering was on its way
from Omaha, the wretched impostor had himself solved
the difficulty by quietly disappearing. As he had
refused to take money from the thousands of his dupes
who had pressed it upon him in their fancied relief from
pain, it was known that he could not be far off, and
some curiosity was at first felt as to his whereabouts&mdash;
particularly by those superstitious ones who continued
to believe he had healed them of their infirmities, not a
few of whom, it appeared, were disposed to credit his
blasphemous claim to have been sent by God.</p>

<p>According to the lookout thus kept for this person, it
was reported that he had been seen to pass on foot
through towns lying south of Denver, meanly dressed
and accompanied by a young man named Linford.
To all inquiries he answered that he was on his way to
fast in the desert as his &quot;Father&quot; had commanded.
His companion was even less communicative, saying
somewhat irritably that his goings and comings were
nobody's business but his own.</p>

<p>Some six months later the remains of the unfortunate
person were found in a wild place far to the south, with
his Bible and his blanket. It was supposed that he had
starved. Of Linford no further trace had been discovered.</p>

<p>The most absurd tales were now told, said Mr.
Gridley, of the miracles of healing wrought by this
person&mdash;told, moreover, by persons of intelligence
whom in ordinary matters one would not hesitate to
trust. There had even been a story started, which was
widely believed, that he had raised the dead; moreover,
many of those who had been deluded into believing
themselves healed, looked forward confidently to his
own resurrection.</p>

<p>Mr. Gridley ventured the opinion that we should be
thankful to the daily press which now disseminates the
news of such things promptly, instead of allowing it to
travel slowly by word of mouth, as it did in less advanced
times&mdash;a process in which a little truth becomes very
shortly a mighty untruth. Even between Denver and
Omaha he had observed that the wonder-tales of this
person grew apace, thus proving the inaccuracy of the
human mind as a reporter of fact. Without the check
of an unemotional daily press Mr. Gridley suspected
that the poor creature's performances would have been
magnified by credulous gossip until he became the
founder of a new religion&mdash;a thing especially to be
dreaded in a day when the people were crazed for any
new thing&mdash;as Paul found them in Athens.</p>

<p>Mr. Gridley mentioned further that the person had
suffered from what the alienists called &quot;morbid delusions
of grandeur&quot;&mdash;believing, indeed, that but One
other in the universe was greater than himself; that he
would sit at the right hand of Power to judge all the
world. His most puerile pretension, however, was that
he meant to live, even if the work required a thousand
years, until such time as he could save all persons into
heaven, so that hell need have no occupants.</p>

<p>But this distressing tale did not move old Allan Delcher
to reconsider his perverse decision, though there
had been ample time for reparation. Placidly he
dropped off one day, a little while after he had cautioned
Clytie to keep the house ready for Bernal's coming;
and to have always on hand one of those fig layer-cakes
of which he was so fond, since as likely as not he would
ask for this the first thing, just as he used to do. It
must seem homelike to him when he did come.</p>

<p>Having betrayed the trust reposed in him by an
unsuspecting grandson, it seemed fitting that he should
fall asleep over that very psalm wherein David describeth
the corruption of the natural man.</p>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">How Edom was Favoured of God and Mammon</h3>

<p>In the years gone, the village of Edom had matured,
even as little boys wax to manhood. Time was when
all but two trains daily sped by it so fast that from
their windows its name over the station door was naught
but a blur. Now all was changed. Many trains
stopped, and people of the city mien descended from or
entered smart traps, yellow depot-wagons or immaculate
victorias, drawn by short-tailed, sophisticated steeds
managed by liveried persons whose scraped faces were
at once impassive and alert.</p>

<p>In its outlying parts, moreover, stately villas now
stood in the midst of grounds hedged, levelled, sprayed,
shaven, trimmed and garnished&mdash;grounds cherished
sacredly with a reverence like unto that once accorded
the Front Room in this same village. Edom, indeed,
had outgrown its villagehood as a country boy in the
city will often outgrow his home ways. That is, it
was still a village in its inmost heart; but outwardly,
at its edges, the distinctions and graces of urban worldliness
had come upon it.</p>

<p>All this from the happy circumstance that Edom lay
in a dale of beauty not too far from the blessed centre of
things requisite. First, one by one, then by families,
then by groups of families, then by cliques, the invaders
had come to promote Edom's importance; one being
brought by the gracious falling of its little hills; one by
its narrow valleys where the quick little waters come
down; one by the clearness of its air; and one by the
cheapness with which simple old farms might be
bought and converted into the most city-like of country
homes.</p>

<p>The old stock of Edom had early learned not to part
with any massive claw-footed sideboard with glass
knobs, or any mahogany four-poster, or tall clock, or
high-boy, except after feigning a distressed reluctance.
It had learned also to hide its consternation at the
prices which this behaviour would eventually induce
the newcomers to pay for such junk. Indeed, it learned
very soon to be a shrewd valuer of old mahogany,
pewter, and china; even to suspect that the buyers might
perceive beauties in it that justified the prices they paid.</p>

<p>Old Edom, too, has its own opinion of the relative
joys of master and servant, the latter being always
debonair, their employers stiff, formal and concerned.
It conceives that the employers, indeed, have but one
pleasure: to stand beholding with anxious solemnity&mdash;
quite as if it were the performance of a religious rite&mdash;
the serious-visaged men who daily barber the lawns
and hedges. It is suspected by old Edomites that the
menials, finding themselves watched at this delicate
task, strive to copy in face and demeanour the solemnity
of the observing employer&mdash;clipping the box hedge one
more fraction of an inch with the wariest caution&mdash;
maintaining outwardly, in short, a most reverent seriousness
which in their secret hearts they do not feel.</p>

<p>Let this be so or not. The point is that Edom had
gone beyond its three churches of Calvin, Wesley and
Luther&mdash;to say nothing of one poor little frame structure
with a cross at the peak, where a handful of benighted
Romanists had long been known to perform their
idolatrous rites. Now, indeed, as became a smartened
village, there was a perfect little Episcopal church of
redstone, stained glass and painted shingles, with a
macadam driveway leading under its dainty <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i>,
and at the base of whose stern little tower an
eager ivy already aspired; a toy-like, yet suggestively
imposing edifice, quite in the manner of smart suburban
churches&mdash;a manner that for want of accurate knowledge
one might call confectioner's gothic.</p>

<p>It was here, in his old home, that the Reverend Allan
Delcher Linford found his first pastorate. Here from
the very beginning he rendered apparent those gifts
that were to make him a power among men. It was
with a lofty but trembling hope that the young novice
began his first service that June morning, before a congregation
known to be hypercritical, composed as it
was of seasoned city communicants, hardened listeners
and watchers, who would appraise his vestments, voice,
manner, appearance, and sermon, in the light of a ripe
experience.</p>

<p>Yet his success was instant. He knew it long before
the service ended&mdash;felt it infallibly all at once in the
midst of his sermon on Faith. From the reading of
his text, &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believed therein
might not perish, but have everlasting life,&quot; the worldly
people before him were held as by invisible wires running
from him to each of them. He felt them sway in
obedience to his tones; they warmed with him and
cooled with him; aspired with him, questioned, agreed,
and glowed with him. They were his&mdash;one with him.
Their eyes saw a young man in the splendour of his
early prime, of a faultless, but truly masculine beauty,
delicate yet manfully rugged, square-chinned, straight-mouthed,
with tawny hair and hazel eyes full of
glittering golden points when his eloquence mounted;
clear-skinned, brilliant, warm-voiced, yet always simple,
direct, earnest; a storehouse of power, yet ornate; a
source of refreshment both physical and spiritual to
all within the field of his magnetism.</p>

<p>So agreed those who listened to that first sermon on
Faith, in which that virtue was said be like the
diamond, made only the brighter by friction. Motionless
his listeners sat while he likened Faith to the giant
engine that has rolled the car of Religion out from the
maze of antiquity into the light of the present day,
where it now waits to be freighted with the precious
fruits of living genius, then to speed on to that hoped-for
golden era when truth shall come forth as a new and
blazing star to light the splendid pageantry of earth,
bound together in one law of universal brotherhood,
independent, yet acknowledging the sovereignty of
Omnipotence.</p>

<p>Rapt were they when, with rare verbal felicity and
unstudied eloquence, the young man pictured himself
standing upon a lofty sunlit mountain, while a storm
raged in the valley below, calling passionately to those
far down in the ebullition to come up to him and mingle
in the blue serene of Faith. Faith was, indeed, a tear
dropped on the world's cold cheek of Doubt to make
it burn forever.</p>

<p>Even those long since <i>blas&eacute;</i> to pulpit oratory thrilled
at the simple beauty of his peroration, which ran:
&quot;<i>Faith!</i> Oh, of all the flowers that swing their golden
censers in the parterre of the human heart, none so
rich, so rare, as this one flower of Faith. Other flowers
there may be that yield as rich perfume, but they must
be crushed in order that their fragrance become perceptible.
But this flower&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>In spite of this triumph, it had taken him still another
year to prevail over one of his hearers. True, she had
met him after that first triumphant ordination sermon
with her black lashes but half-veiling the admiration
that shone warm in the gray of her eyes; and his low
assurance, &quot;Nance, you <i>please</i> me! Really you do!&quot;
as his yellow eyes lingered down her rounded slenderness
from summer bonnet to hem of summer gown, rippled
her face with a colour she had to laugh away.</p>

<p>Yet she had been obstinate and wondering. There
had to be a year in which she knew that one she dreamed
of would come back; another in which she believed he
might; another in which she hoped he would&mdash;and yet
another in which she realised that dreams and hopes
alike were vain&mdash;vain, though there were times in
which she seemed to feel again the tingling life of that
last hand-clasp; times when he called to her; times
when she had the absurd consciousness that his mind
pressed upon hers. There had been so many years
and so much wonder&mdash;and no one came. It had been
foolish indeed. And then came a year of wondering
at the other. The old wonder concerning this one,
excited by a certain fashion of rendering his head in
unison with his shoulders&mdash;as might the statue of
Perfect Beauty turn upon its pedestal&mdash;with its baser
residue of suspicion, had been happily allayed by a
closer acquaintance with Allan. One must learn, it
seemed, to distrust those lightning-strokes of prejudice
that flash but once at the first contact between human
clouds.</p>

<p>Yet in the last year there had come another wonder
that excited a suspicion whose troubling-power was
absurdly out of all true proportion.</p>

<p>It was in the matter of seeing things&mdash;that is, funny
things.</p>

<p>Doubtless she had told him a few things more or less
funny that had seemed to move him to doubt or perplexity,
or to mere seriousness; but, indeed, they had
seemed less funny to her after that. For example, she
had told Aunt Bell the anecdote of the British lady of
title who says to her curate, concerning a worthy relative
by marriage lately passed away, toward whom she
has felt kindly despite his inferior station: &quot;Of course
I <i>couldn't</i> know him here&mdash;but we shall meet in heaven.&quot;
Aunt Bell had been edified by this, remarking earnestly
that such differences would indeed be wiped out in
heaven. Yet when Nancy went to Allan in a certain
bubbling condition over the anecdote itself and Aunt
Bell's comment thereon, he made her repeat it slowly,
after the first hurried telling, and had laughed but
awkwardly with her, rather as if it were expected of
him&mdash;with an eye vacant of all but wonder&mdash;like a
traveller not sure he had done right to take the left-hand
turn at the last cross-roads.</p>

<p>Again, the bishop who ordained him had, in a relaxed
and social moment after the ceremony, related that
little classic of Bishop Meade, who, during the fight
over a certain disestablishment measure, was asked
by a lobbyist how he would vote. The dignified prelate
had replied that he would vote for the bill, for he
held that every man should have the right to choose his
own way to heaven. None the less, he would continue
to be certain that a gentleman would always take the
Episcopal way. To Nancy Allan retold this, adding,</p>

<p>&quot;You know, I'm going to use it in a sermon some
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;it's very funny,&quot; she answered, a little uncertainly.</p>

<p>&quot;Funny?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course&mdash;I've heard the bishop tell it myself&mdash;
and I know <i>he</i> thinks it funny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;then I'll use it as a funny story. Of course,
it <i>is</i> funny&mdash;I only thought&quot;&mdash;what it was he only
thought Nancy never knew.</p>

<p>Small bits of things to wonder at, these were, and
the wonder brought no illumination. She only knew
there were times when they two seemed of different
worlds, bereft of power to communicate; and at these
times his superbly assured wooing left her slightly
dazed.</p>

<p>But there were other times, and different&mdash;and
slowly she became used to the idea of him&mdash;persuaded
both by his own court and by the spirited encomiums
that he evoked from Aunt Bell.</p>

<p>Aunt Bell was at that time only half persuaded by
Allan to re-enter the church of her blameless infancy.
She was still minded to seek a little longer outside the
fold that <i>rapport</i> with the Universal Mind which she
had never ceased to crave. In this process she had
lately discarded Esoteric Buddhism for Subliminal
Monitions induced by Psychic Breathing and correct
breakfast-food. For all that, she felt competent to
declare that Allan was the only possible husband for her
niece, and her niece came to suspect that this might
be so.</p>

<p>When at last she had wondered herself into a state
of inward readiness&mdash;a state still governed by her outward
habit of resistance, this last was beaten down by
a letter from Mrs. Tednick, who had been a school
friend as Clara Tremaine, and was now married, apparently
with results not too desirable.</p>

<p>&quot;Never, my dear,&quot; ran the letter to Nancy, &quot;permit
yourself to think of marrying a man who has
not a sense of humour. Do I seem flippant? Don't
think it. I am conveying to you the inestimable benefits
of a trained observation. Humour saves a man
from being impossible in any number of ways&mdash;from
boring you to beating you. (You may live to realise
that the tragedy of <i>the first</i> is not less poignant than that
of the second.) Whisper, dear!&mdash;All men are equally
vain&mdash;at least in their ways with a woman&mdash;but humour
assuredly preserves many unto death from betraying
it egregiously. Beware of him if he lack it. He has
power to crucify you daily, and yet be in honest ignorance
of your tortures. Don't think I am cynical&mdash;and
indeed, my own husband is one of the best and dearest
of souls in the world, <i>the biggest heart</i>&mdash;but be sure you
marry no man without humour. Don't think a man
has it merely because he tells funny stories; the humour
I mean is a kind of sense of the fitness of things that
keeps a man from forgetting himself. And if he
hasn't humour, don't think he can make you happy,
even if his vanity doesn't show. He can't&mdash;after the
expiration of that brief period in which the vanity of
each is a holy joy to the other. Remember now!&quot;</p>

<p>Curiously enough this well-intended homily had the
effect of arousing in Nancy an instant sense of loyalty
to Allan. She suffered little flashes of resentment at
the thought that Clara Tremaine should seem to depreciate
one toward whom she felt herself turning with
a sudden defensive tenderness. And this, though it
was clear to the level eye of reason that Clara must
have been generalising on observations made far from
Edom. But her loyal spirit was not less eager to resent
an affront because it might seem to have been aimless.</p>

<p>And thereafter, though never ceasing to wonder,
Nancy was won. Her consent, at length, went to him
in her own volume of Browning, a pink rose shut in
upon &quot;A Woman's Last Word&quot;&mdash;its petals bruised
against the verses:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;What so false as truth is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; False to thee?<br>
&nbsp;Where the serpent's tooth is, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shun the tree.</p>

<p>&quot;Where the apple reddens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Never pry&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;Lest we lose our Edens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eve and I.</p>

<p>&quot;Be a god and hold me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a charm!<br>
&nbsp;Be a man and fold me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thine arm!&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>That was a moment of sweetness, of utter rest, of
joyous peace&mdash;fighting no longer.</p>

<p>A little while and he was before her, proud as a
conquerer may be&mdash;glad as a lover should.</p>

<p>&quot;I always knew it, Nance&mdash;you <i>had</i> to give in.&quot;</p>

<p>Then as she drooped in his arms, a mere fragrant,
pulsing, glad submission&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You have <i>always</i> pleased me, Nancy. I know I
shall never regret my choice.&quot;</p>

<p>And Nancy, scarce hearing, wondered happily on his
breast.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Winning of Browett</h3>

<p>A thoughtful Pagan once reported dignity to consist
not in possessing honours, but in the consciousness
that we deserve them. It is a theory fit to console
multitudes. Edom's young rector was not only consoled
by it, he was stimulated. To his ardent nature,
the consciousness of deserving honour was the first
vital step toward gaining it. Those things that he
believed himself to deserve he forthwith subjected
to the magnetic rays of his desire: Knowing with the
inborn certainty of the successful, that they must finally
yield to such silent, coercing influence and soon or
late gravitate toward him in obedience to the same law
that draws the apple to the earth's lap. In this manner
had the young man won his prizes for oratory; so had
he won his wife; so had he won his first pastorate; so
now would he win that prize he was conscious of meriting
next&mdash;a city parish&mdash;a rectorate in the chief seat
of his church in America, where was all wealth and
power as well as the great among men, to be swayed by
his eloquence and brought at last to the Master's feet.
And here, again, would his future enlarge to prospects
now but mistily surmised&mdash;prospects to be moved upon
anon with triumphant tread. Infinite aspiration opening
ever beyond itself&mdash;this was his. Meantime, step
by step, with zealous care for the accuracy of each,
with eyes always ahead, leaving nothing undone&mdash;he
was forever fashioning the moulds into which the
Spirit should materialise his benefits.</p>

<p>The first step was the winning of Browett&mdash;old
Cyrus Browett, whose villa, in the fashion of an English
manor-house, was a feature of remark even to the
Edom summer dwellers&mdash;a villa whose wide grounds
were so swept, garnished, trimly flowered, hedge-bordered
and shrub-upholstered that, to old Edom,
they were like stately parlours built foolishly out of
doors.</p>

<p>Months had the rector of tiny St. Anne's waited for
Browett to come to him, knowing that Browett must
come in the end. One less instinctively wise would
have made the mistake of going to Browett. Not this
one, whose good spirit warned him that his puissance
lay rather with groups of men than with individuals.
From back of the chancel railing he could sway the
crowd and make it all his own; whereas, taking that
same crowd singly, and beyond his sacerdotal functions,
he might be at the mercy of each man composing it.
He knew, in short, that Cyrus Browett as one of his
congregation on a Sabbath morning would be a mere
atom in the plastic cosmos below him; whereas Browett
by himself, with the granite hardness of his crag-like
face, his cool little green eyes&mdash;unemotional as two
algebraic x's&mdash;would be a matter fearfully different.
Even his white moustache, close-clipped as his own
hedges, and guarding a stiff, chilled mouth, was a thing
grimly repressed, telling that the man was quite invulnerable
to his own vanity. A human Browett would
have permitted that moustache to mitigate its surroundings
with some flowing grace. He was, indeed,
no adversary to meet alone in the open field&mdash;for one
who could make him in a crowd a mere string of many
to his harp.</p>

<p>The morning so long awaited came on a second
Sunday after Trinity. Cyrus Browett, in whose keeping
was the very ark of the money covenant, alighted
from his coup&eacute; under the <i>porte-coch&egrave;re</i> of candied
Gothic and humbly took seat in his pew like a mere
worshipper of God.</p>

<p>As such&mdash;a man among men&mdash;the young rector
looked calmly down upon him, letting him sink into
the crowd-entity which always became subject to him.</p>

<p>His rare, vibrant tones&mdash;tones that somehow carried
the subdued light and warmth of stained glass&mdash;rolled
out in moving volume:</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth
keep silence before him.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, still as a mere worshipper of God, that Prince
of the power of Mammon down in front knelt humbly
to say after the young rector above him that he had
erred and strayed like a lost sheep, followed too much
the devices of his own heart, leaving undone those
things he ought to have done, and doing those things
which he ought not to have done; that there was no
health in him; yet praying that he might, thereafter,
lead a godly, righteous and sober life to the glory of
God's holy name. Even to Allan there was something
affecting in this&mdash;a sort of sardonic absurdity in
Browett's actually speaking thus.</p>

<p>The kneeling financier was indeed a gracious and
lovely spectacle to the young clergyman, and in his
next words, above the still-bended congregation, his
tones grew warmly moist with an unction that thrilled
his hearers as never before. Movingly, indeed, upon
the authority that God hath given to his ministers, did
he declare and pronounce to his people, being penitent,
the absolution and remission of their sins. Wonderful,
in truth, had it been if his hearers did not thrill, for the
minister himself was thrilled as never before. He,
Allan Delcher Linford, was absolving and remitting
the sins of a man whose millions were counted by the
hundred, a god of money and of power&mdash;who yet
cringed before him out there like one who feared and
worshipped.</p>

<p>Nor did he here make the mistake that many another
would have made. Instead of preaching to Cyrus
Browett alone&mdash;preaching at him&mdash;he preached as
usual to his congregation. If his glance fell, now and
then, upon the face of Browett, he saw it only through
the haze of his own fervour&mdash;a patch of granite-gray
holding two pricking points of light. Not once was
Browett permitted to feel himself more than one of a
crowd; not once was he permitted to rise above his mere
atomship, nor feel that he received more attention than
the humblest worshipper in arrears for pew-rent. Yet,
though the young rector regarded Browett as but
one of many, he knew infallibly the instant that invisible
wire was strung between them, and felt, thereafter,
every tug of opposition or signal of agreement that
flashed from Browett's mind, knowing in the end,
without a look, that he had won Browett's approval
and even excited his interest.</p>

<p>For the sermon had been strangely, wonderfully
suited to Browett's peculiar tastes. Hardly could a
sermon have been better planned to win him. The
choice of the text itself: &quot;And thou shalt take no gift:
for the gift blindeth the wise and perverteth the words
of the righteous,&quot; was perfect art.</p>

<p>The plea was for intellectual honesty, for academic
freedom, for fearless independence, which were said
to be the crowning glories in the diadem of man's
attributes. Fearlessly, then, did the speaker depreciate
both the dogmatism of religion and the dogmatism
of science. &quot;Much of what we call religion,&quot; he said,
&quot;is only the superstition of the past; much of what we
call science is but the superstition of the present.&quot; He
pleaded that religion might be an ever-living growth
in the human heart, not a dead formulary of dogmatic
origin. True, organisation was necessary, but in the
realm of spiritual essentials a creed drawn up in the
fourth century should not be treated as if it were the
final expression of the religious consciousness <i>in secula
seculorum</i>. One should, indeed, be prepared for the
perpetual restatement of religious truth, fearlessly
submitting the most cherished convictions to the light
of each succeeding age.</p>

<p>Yet, especially, should it not be forgotten in an age of
ultra-physicism, of social and economic heterodoxies,
that there must ever be in human society, according to
the blessed ordinance of God, princes and subjects,
masters and proletariat, rich and poor, learned and
ignorant, nobles and plebeians&mdash;yet all united in the
bonds of love to help one another attain their moral
welfare on earth and their last end in heaven;&mdash;all
united in the bonds of fraternal good-will, independent
yet acknowledging the sovereignty of Omnipotence.</p>

<p>He closed with these words of Voltaire: &quot;We must
love our country whatever injustice we suffer in it, as
we must love and serve the Supreme Being, notwithstanding
the superstitions and fanaticism which so
often dishonour His worship.&quot;</p>

<p>The sermon was no marked achievement in coherence,
but neither was Browett a coherent personality.
It was, however, a swift, vivid sermon&mdash;a short and a
busy one, with a reason for each of its parts, incoherent
though the parts were. For Browett was a cynic
doubter of his own faith; at once an admirer of Voltaire
and a believer in the Established Order of Things;
despising a radical and a conservative equally, but,
hating more than either, a clumsy compromiser. He
must be preached to as one not yet brought into that
flock purchased by God with the blood of His Son;
and at the same time, as one who had always been of
that flock and was now inalienable from it. In a word,
Browett's doubt and his belief had both to be fed from
the same spoon, a fact that all young preachers of God's
word would not have fathomed.</p>

<p>Thus our young rector proved his power. His future
rolled visibly toward him. During the rest of that
service there sounded in his ears an undertone from
out the golden centre of that future: &quot;<i>Reverend Father
in God, we present unto you this godly and well-learned
man to be ordained and consecrated Bishop&mdash;&mdash;</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Rewarded, indeed, was he for the trouble he had
taken long months before to build that particular sermon
to fit Browett, after specifications confided to him
by an obliging parishioner&mdash;keeping it ready to use at
a second's notice, on the first morning that Browett
should appear.</p>

<p>How diminished would be that envious railing at
Success could we but know the hidden pains by which
alone its victories of seeming ease are won!</p>

<p>The young minister could now meet Browett as man
to man, having established a prestige.</p>

<p>It had been said by those who would fain have
branded him with the stigma of disrepute that Browett's
ethics were inferior to those of the prairie wolf; meaning,
perhaps, that he might kill more sheep than he could
possibly devour.</p>

<p>Browett had views of his own in this matter. As a
tentative evolutionist he looked upon his survival as
unimpeachable evidence of his fitness,&mdash;as the eagle is
 fitter than the lamb it may fasten upon. Again, as a
 believer in Revealed Religion, he accepted human
 society according to the ordinance of God, deeming
 himself as Master to be but the rightful, divinely-instituted
 complement of his humblest servant&mdash;the
 two of them necessary poles in the world spiritual.</p>

<p>One of the few fads of Browett being the memorial
window, it was also said by enviers that if he would
begin to erect a window to every small competitor his
Trust had squeezed to death there would be an unprecedented
flurry in stained glass. But Browett knew,
as an evolutionist, that the eagle has a divine right to
the lamb if it can come safely off with it; as a Christian,
that one carries out the will of God as indubitably in
preserving the established order of prince and subject,
of noble and plebeian, as in giving of his abundance to
relieve the necessitous&mdash;or in endowing universities
which should teach the perpetual sacredness of the
established order of things in Church and State.</p>

<p>In short, he derived comfort from both poles of his
belief&mdash;one the God of Moses, a somewhat emotional
god, not entirely uncarnal&mdash;the other the god of Spencer,
an unemotional and unimaginative god of Law.</p>

<p>It followed that he was much taken with a preacher
who could answer so appositely to the needs of his soul
as did this impressive young man in a chance sermon
of unstudied eloquence.</p>

<p>There were social meetings in which Browett dispassionately
confirmed these early impressions gained
under the spell of a matchless oratory, and in due time
there followed an invitation to the young rector of
St. Anne's of Edom to preach at the Church of St.
Antipas, which was Browett's city church.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Belated Martyrdom</h3>

<p>The rectory at Edom was hot with the fever of preparation.
The invitation to preach at St. Antipas
meant an offer of that parish should the preaching be
approved. It was a most desirable parish&mdash;Browett's
city church being as smart as one of his steam yachts
or his private train (for nothing less than a train sufficed
him now&mdash;though there were those of the green eyes
who pretended to remember, with heavy sarcasm, the
humbler day when he had but a beggarly private
car, coupled to the rear of a common Limited). It
was, moreover, a high church, its last rector having
been put away for the narrowness of refusing to &quot;enrich
the service.&quot; This was the church and this the patron
above all others that the Reverend Allan Delcher
Linford would have chosen, and earnestly did he pray
that God in His wisdom impart to him the grace to
please Browett and those whom Browett permitted to
have a nominal voice in the control of St. Antipas.</p>

<p>Both Aunt Bell and Nancy came to feel the strain of
it all. The former promised to &quot;go into the silence&quot;
each day and &quot;hold the thought of success,&quot; thereby
drawing psychic power for him from the Reservoir of the Eternal.</p>

<p>Nancy could only encourage by wifely sympathy,
being devoid of those psychic powers that distinguished
Aunt Bell. Tenderly she hovered about Allan the
morning he began to write the first of the three sermons
he was to preach.</p>

<p>As for him, though heavy with the possibilities of
the moment, he was yet cool and centred; resigned to
what might be, yet hopeful; his manner was determined,
yet gentle, almost sweet&mdash;the manner of one who has
committed all to God and will now put no cup from
him, how bitter soever.</p>

<p>&quot;I am so hopeful, dearest, for your sake,&quot; his wife
said, softly, wishing to reveal her sympathy yet fearful
lest she might obtrude it. He was arranging many
sheets of notes before him.</p>

<p>&quot;What will the first one be?&quot; she asked. He
straightened in his chair.</p>

<p>&quot;I've made up my mind, Nance! It's a wealthy
congregation&mdash;one of the wealthiest in the city&mdash;but
I shall preach first from the parable of Dives and Lazarus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that&mdash;a little&mdash;wouldn't something else do as
well&mdash;something that wouldn't seem quite so personal?&quot;</p>

<p>He smiled up with fond indulgence. &quot;That's the
woman of it&mdash;concession for temporal advantage.&quot;
Then more seriously he added, &quot;I wouldn't be true to
myself, Nance, if I went down there in any spirit of
truckling to wealth. Public approval is a most desirable
luxury, I grant you&mdash;wealth and ease are desirable
luxuries, and the favour of those in power&mdash;but they're
only luxuries. And I know in this matter but one real
necessity: my own self-approval. If consciously I
preached a polite sermon there, my own soul would
accuse me and I should be as a leaf in the wind for
power. No, Nance&mdash;never urge me to be untrue to
that divine Christ-self within me! If I cannot be my
best self before God, I am nothing. I must preach
Christ and Him crucified, whether it be to the wealthy
of St. Antipas or only to believing poverty.&quot;</p>

<p>Stung with contrition, she was quick to say, &quot;Oh,
my dearest, I didn't mean you to be untrue! Only it
seemed unnecessary to affront them in your very first
sermon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been divinely guided, Nance. No considerations
of expediency can deflect me now. This <i>had</i> to be!
I admit that I had my hour of temptation&mdash;but that
has gone, and thank God my integrity survives it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how much bigger you are than I am, dearest!&quot;
She looked down at him proudly as she stood close to
his side, smoothing the tawny hair. Then she laid one
finger along his lips and made the least little kissing
noise with her own lips&mdash;a trick of affection learned in
the early days of their love. After a little she stole from
his side, leaving him with head bent in prayerful study
&mdash;to be herself alone with her new assurance.</p>

<p>It was moments like this that she had come to long
for and to feed her love upon. Nor need it be concealed
that there had not been one such for many
months. The situation had been graver than she
was willing to acknowledge to herself. Not only had
she not ceased to wonder since the first days of her marriage,
but she had begun to smile in her wonder, fancying
from time to time that certain plain answers came
to it&mdash;and not at all realising that a certain kind of
smile is love's unforgivable blasphemy; conscious only
that the smile left a strange hurt in her heart.</p>

<p>For a little hour she stayed alone with her joy, fondly
turning the light of her newly fed faith upon an idol
whose clearness of line and purity of tint had become
blurred in a dusk of wondering&mdash;an idol that had begun,
she now realised with a shudder, to bulk almost grotesquely
through that deepening gloom of doubt.</p>

<p>Now all was well again. In this new light the dear
idol might even at times show a dual personality&mdash;one
kneeling beside her very earnestly to worship the other
with her. Why not, since the other showed itself truly
worthy of adoration? With faith made new in her
husband&mdash;and, therefore, in God&mdash;she went to Aunt
Bell.</p>

<p>She found that lady in touch with the cosmic forces,
over her book, &quot;The Beautiful Within,&quot; her particular
chapter being headed, &quot;Psychology of Rest: Rhythms
and Sub-rhythms of Activity and Repose; their Synchronism
with Subliminal Spontaneity.&quot; Over this
frank revelation of hidden truths Aunt Bell's handsome
head was, for the moment, nodding in sub-rhythms of
psychic placidity&mdash;a state from which Nancy's animated
entrance sufficed to arouse her. As the proud wife
spoke, she divested herself of the psychic restraint with
something very like a carnal yawn behind her book.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Bell! Isn't Allan <i>fine</i>! Of course, in a
way, it's too bad&mdash;doubtless he'll spoil his chances for
the thing I know he's set his heart upon&mdash;and he knows
it, too&mdash;but he's going calmly ahead as if the day for
martyrs to the truth hadn't long since gone by. Oh,
dear, martyrs are <i>so</i> dowdy and out-of-date&mdash;but there
he is, a great, noble, beautiful soul, with a sense of
integrity and independence that is stunning!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What has Allan been saying now?&quot; asked Aunt
Bell, curiously unmoved.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Said?</i> It's what he's <i>doing!</i> The dear, big, stupid
thing is going down there to preach the very first Sunday
about Dives and Lazarus&mdash;the poor beggar in
Abraham's bosom and the rich man down below, you
remember?&quot; she added, as Aunt Bell seemed still to
hover about the centre of psychic repose.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, think of preaching that primitive doctrine to
 <i>any one</i> in this age&mdash;then think of a young minister
 talking it to a church of rich men and expecting to
 receive a call from them!&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell surveyed the plump and dimpled whiteness
of her small hands with more than her usual
studious complacence. &quot;My dear,&quot; she said at last,
&quot;no one has a greater admiration for Allan than I have
&mdash;but I've observed that he usually knows what he's
about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, he knows what he's about now, Aunt Bell!&quot;
There was a swift little warmth in her tones&mdash;&quot;but he
says he can't do otherwise. He's going deliberately to
spoil his chances for a call to St. Antipas by a piece of
mere early-Christian quixotism. And you must see
how <i>great</i> he is, Aunt Bell. Do you know&mdash;there have
been times when I've misjudged Allan. I didn't know
his simple genuineness. He wants that church, yet he
will not, as so many in his place would do, make the
least concession to its people.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell now brought a coldly critical scrutiny to
bear upon one small foot which she thrust absently out
until its profile could be seen.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he will have his reward,&quot; she said. &quot;Although
it is many years since I broadened into what I may
call the higher unbelief, I have never once suspected,
my dear, that merit fails of its reward. And above all,
I have faith in Allan, in his&mdash;well, his psychic nature is
so perfectly attuned with the Universal that Allan simply
<i>cannot</i> harm himself. Even when he seems deliberately
to invite misfortune, fortune comes instead. So
cheer up, and above all, practise going into the silence
and holding the thought of success for him. I think
Allan will attend very acceptably to the mere details.&quot;</p>

<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Walls of St. Antipas Fall at the Third Blast</h3>

<p>On that dreaded morning a few weeks later, when
the young minister faced a thronged St. Antipas at
eleven o'clock service, his wife looked up at him from
Aunt Bell's side in a pew well forward&mdash;the pew of
Cyrus Browett&mdash;looked up at him in trembling, loving
wonder. Then a little tender half-smile of perfect
faith went dreaming along her just-parted lips. Let
the many prototypes of Dives in St. Antipas&mdash;she could
see the relentless profile of their chief at her right&mdash;be
offended by his rugged speech: he should find atoning
comfort in her new love. Like Luther, he must stand
there to say out the soul of him, and she was prostrate
before his brave greatness.</p>

<p>When, at last, he came to read the biting verses of the
parable, her heart beat as if it would be out to him, her
face paled and hardened with the strain of his ordeal.</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried
by the angels into Abraham's bosom; the rich man also
died and was buried.</p>

<p>&quot;And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and
seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>

<p>&quot;And he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on
me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in
water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.'</p>

<p>&quot;But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that thou in thy
lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus
evil things; but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.'&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>The sermon began. Unflinchingly the preacher
pointed out that Dives, apparently, lay in hell for no
other reason than that he had been a rich man; no sin
was imputed to him; not even unbelief; he had not only
transgressed no law, but was doubtless a respectable,
God-fearing man of irreproachable morals&mdash;sent to
hell for his wealth.</p>

<p>And Lazarus appeared to have won heaven merely
by reason of his poverty. No virtue, no active good
conduct, was accredited to him.</p>

<p>Reading with the eye of common understanding,
Jesus taught that the rich merited eternal torment by
reason of their riches, and the poor merited eternal life
by reason of their poverty, a belief that one might hear
declared even to-day. Nor was this view attested solely
by this parable. Jesus railed constantly at those in high
places, at the rich and at lawyers, and the chief priests
and elders and those in authority&mdash;declaring that he
had been sent, not to them, but to the poor who needed
a physician.</p>

<p>But was there not a seeming inconsistency here in the
teachings of the Master? If the poor achieved heaven
automatically by their mere poverty, <i>why were they
still needing a physician?</i> Under that view, why were
not the rich those who needed a physician&mdash;according
to the literal words of Jesus?</p>

<p>Up to the close of this passage the orator's manner
had been one of glacial severity&mdash;of a sternness apparently
checked by rare self-control from breaking into a
denunciation of the modern Dives. Then all was
changed. His face softened and lighted; the broad
shoulders seemed to relax from their uncompromising
squareness; he stood more easily upon his feet; he
glowed with a certain encouraging companionableness.</p>

<p>Was that, indeed, the teaching of Jesus&mdash;as if in
New York to-day he might say, &quot;I have come to Third
Avenue rather than to Fifth?&quot; Can this crudely
literal reading of his words prevail? Does it not carry
its own refutation&mdash;the extreme absurdity of supposing
that Jesus would come to the squalid Jews of the East
Side and denounce the better elements that maintain a
church like St. Antipas?</p>

<p>The fallacy were easily probed. A modern intelligence
can scarcely prefigure heaven or hell as a reward
or punishment for mere carnal comfort or discomfort
&mdash;as many literal-minded persons believe that Jesus
taught. The Son of Man was too subtle a philosopher
to teach that a rich man is lost by his wealth and a poor
man saved by his poverty, though primitive minds took
this to be his meaning. Some primitive minds still
believe this&mdash;witness the frequent attempts to read a
literal meaning into certain other words of Jesus: the
command, for example, that a man should give up his
cloak also, if he be sued for his coat. Little acumen is
required to see that no society could protect itself against
the depredations of the lawless under such a system of
non-resistance; and we may be sure that Jesus had no
intention of tearing down the social structure or destroying
vested rights. Those who demand a literal construction
of the parable of Dives and Lazarus must
look for it in the Bowery melodrama, wherein
the wealthy only are vicious and poverty alone
is virtuous.</p>

<p>We have only to consider the rawness of this conception
to perceive that Jesus is not to be taken literally.</p>

<p>Who, then, is the rich man and who the poor&mdash;who is
the Dives and who the Lazarus of this intensely dramatic
parable?</p>

<p>Dives is but the type of the spiritually rich man who
has not charity for his spiritually poor brother; of the
man rich in faith who will not trouble to counsel the
doubting; of the one rich in humility who will yet not
seek to save his neighbour from arrogance; of him
rich in charity who indifferently views his uncharitable
brethren; of the man rich in hope who will not strive
to make hopeful the despairing; of the one rich in
graces of the Holy Ghost who will not seek to reclaim
the unsanctified beggar at his gate.</p>

<p>And who is Lazarus but a type of the aspiring&mdash;the
soul-hungry, whether he be a millionaire or a poor clerk
&mdash;the determined seeker whose eye is single and whose
whole body is full of light? In this view, surely more
creditable to the intellect of our Saviour, mere material
wealth ceases to signify; the Dives of spiritual reality
may be the actual beggar rich in faith yet indifferent
to the soul-hunger of the faithless; while poor Lazarus
may be the millionaire, thirsting, hungering, aspiring,
day after day, for crumbs of spiritual comfort that the
beggar, out of the abundance of his faith, would never
miss.</p>

<p>Christianity has suffered much from our failure to
give the Saviour due credit for subtlety. So far as
money&mdash;mere wealth&mdash;is a soul-factor at all, it must be
held to increase rather than to diminish its possessor's
chances of salvation, but not in merely providing the
refinements of culture and the elegances of modern
luxury and good taste, important though these are to
the spirit's growth. The true value of wealth to the
soul&mdash;a value difficult to over-estimate&mdash;is that it provides
opportunity for, and encourages the cultivation
of, that virtue which is &quot;the greatest of all these&quot;; that
virtue which &quot;suffereth long and is kind; which vaunteth
not itself and is not puffed up&quot;&mdash;Charity, in short.
While not denying the simple joys of penury, nor forgetting
the Saviour's promises to the poor and meek and
lowly, it is still easy to understand that charity is less
likely to be a vigorous soul-growth in a poor man than
in a rich. The poor man may possess it as a germ, a
seed; but the rich man is, through superior prowess in
the struggle for existence, in a position to cultivate this
virtue; and who will say that he has not cultivated it?
Certainly no one acquainted with the efforts of our
wealthy men to uplift the worthy poor. A certain
modern sentimentality demands that poverty be abolished
&mdash;ignoring those pregnant words of Jesus&mdash;&quot;the
poor ye have <i>always</i> with you&quot;&mdash;forgetting, indeed,
that human society is composed of unequal parts, even
as the human body; that equality exists among the
social members only in this: that all men have their
origin in God the Creator, have sinned in Adam, and
have been, by the sacrificial blood of God's only begotten
Son, born of the Virgin Mary, equally redeemed into
eternal life, if they will but accept Christ as their only
true Saviour;&mdash;forgetting indeed that to abolish poverty
would at once prevent all manifestations of human
nature's most beauteous trait and virtue&mdash;Charity.</p>

<p>Present echoes from the business world indicate that
the poor man to-day, with his vicious discontent, his
preposterous hopes of trades-unionism, and his impracticable
and very <i>un-Christian</i> dreams of an industrial
millennium, is the true and veritable Dives, rich in arrogance
and poor in that charity of judgment which the
millionaire has so abundantly shown himself to possess.</p>

<p>The remedy was for the world to come up higher.
Standing upon one of the grand old peaks of the Rocky
Mountains, the speaker had once witnessed a scene in
the valley below which, for beauty of illustration of the
thought in hand, the world could not surpass. He told
his hearers what the scene was. And he besought
them to come up to the rock of Charity and mingle in
the blue serene. Charity&mdash;a tear dropped on the world's
cold cheek of intolerance to make it burn forever! Or
it was the grand motor-power which, like a giant engine,
has rolled the car of civilisation out from the maze of
antiquity into the light of the present day where it now
waits to be freighted with the precious fruits of living
genius, then to speed on to that hoped-for golden era
when truth shall rise as a new and blazing star to light
the splendid pageantry of earth, bound together in
one law of universal brotherhood, independent, yet
acknowledging the sovereignty of Omnipotence. Charity
indeed was what Voltaire meant to inculcate when
he declared: &quot;Atheism and fanaticism are the two poles
of a universe of confusion and horror. The narrow
zone of virtue is between these two. March with a
firm step in that path; believe in a good God and do
good.&quot;</p>

<p>The peroration was beautifully simple, thrilling the
vast throng with a sudden deeper conviction of the
speaker's earnestness: &quot;<i>Charity!</i> Oh, of all the flowers
that have swung their golden censers in the parterre of
the human heart, none so rich, so rare as this one flower
of charity. Other flowers there may be that yield as
rich perfume, but they must be crushed before their
fragrance becomes perceptible; but <i>this</i> flower at early
morn, at burning noon and when the dew of eve is on
the flowers, has coursed its way down the garden walk,
out through the deep, dark dell, over the burning plain,
and up the mountain side&mdash;<i>up</i>, ever UP it rises into the
beautiful blue&mdash;up along the cloudy corridors of the
day, up along the misty pathway to the skies till it
touches the beautiful shore and mingles with the breath
of angels.&quot;</p>

<p>Hardly was there a dissenting voice in all St. Antipas
that Sabbath upon the proposal that this powerful
young preacher be called to its pulpit. The few who
warily suggested that he might be too visionary, not
sufficiently in touch with the present day, were quieted
the following Sabbath by a very different sermon on
certain flaws in the fashionable drama.</p>

<p>The one and only possible immorality in this world,
contended the speaker, was untruth. A sermon was
as immoral as any stage play if the soul of it was not
Truth; and a stage play became as moral as a sermon
if its soul was truth. The special form of untruth he
attacked was what he styled &quot;the drama of the glorified
wanton.&quot; Warmly and ably did he denounce the pernicious
effect of those plays, that take the wanton for
a heroine and sentimentalise her into a morbid attractiveness.
The stage should show life, and the wanton,
being of life, might be portrayed; but let it be with
ruthless fidelity. She must not be falsified into a
creature of fine sensibilities and lofty emotions&mdash;a
thing of dangerous plausibility to the innocent.</p>

<p>The last doubter succumbed on the third Sabbath,
when he preached from the warning of Jesus that
many would come after him, performing in his name
wonders that might deceive, were it possible, even the
very elect. The sermon likened this generation to
the people Paul found in Athens, running curiously
after any new god; after Christian Science&mdash;which he
took the liberty of remarking was neither Christian nor
scientific&mdash;or mental science, spiritism, theosophy,
clairvoyance, all black arts, straying from the fold of
truth into outer darkness&mdash;forgetting that &quot;God so
loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believed therein might not perish, but have
everlasting life.&quot; As this was the sole means of salvation
that God had provided, the time was, obviously,
one fraught with vital interest to every thinking man.</p>

<p>As a sagacious member of the Board of Trustees
remarked, it would hardly have been possible to preach
three sermons better calculated, each in its way, to
win the approval of St. Antipas.</p>

<p>The call came and was accepted after the signs of
due and prayerful consideration. But as for Nancy,
she had left off certain of her wonderings forever.</p>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">There Entereth the Serpent of Inappreciation</h3>

<p>For the young rector of St. Antipas there followed
swift, rich, high-coloured days&mdash;days in which he
might have framed more than one triumphant reply
to that poet who questioned why the spirit of mortal
should be proud, intimating that it should not be.</p>

<p>Also was the handsome young rector's parish proud
of him; proud of his executive ability as shown in the
management of its many organised activities, religious
and secular; its Brotherhood of St. Bartholomew, its
Men's Club, Women's Missionary Association, Guild
and Visiting Society, King's Daughters, Sewing School,
Poor Fund, and still others; proud of his decorative
personality, his impressive oratory and the modern note
in his preaching; proud that its ushers must each Sabbath
morning turn away many late-comers. Indeed,
the whole parish had been born to a new spiritual life
since that day when the worship at St. Antipas had
been kept simple to bareness by a stubborn and perverse
reactionary. In this happier day St. Antipas
was known for its advanced ritual, for a service so
beautifully enriched that a new spiritual warmth pervaded
the entire parish. The doctrine of the Real
Presence was not timidly minced, but preached unequivocally,
with dignified boldness. Also there was a
confessional, and the gracious burning of incense. In
short, St. Antipas throve, and the grace of the Holy
Ghost palpably took possession of its worshippers.
The church was become the smartest church in the
diocese, and its communicants were held to have a
tone.</p>

<p>And to these communicants their rector of the flawless
pulchritude was a gracious spectacle, not only in
the performance of his sacerdotal offices, but on the
thoroughfares of the city, where his distinction was
not less apparent than back of the chancel rail.</p>

<p>A certain popular avenue runs between rows of once
splendid mansions now struggling a little awkwardly
into trade on their lowest floors, like impoverished but
courageous gentlefolk. To these little tragedies, however,
the pedestrian throng is obtuse&mdash;blind to the
pathos of those still haughty upper floors, silent and
reserved, behind drawn curtains, while the lower two
floors are degraded into shops. In so far as the throng
is not busied with itself, its attention is upon the roadway,
where is ever passing a festival procession of
Success, its floats of Worth Rewarded being the costliest
and shiniest of the carriage-maker's craft&mdash;eloquent
of true dignity and fineness even in the swift silence of
their rubber tires. This is a spectacle to be viewed
seriously; to be mocked at only by the flippant, though
the moving pedestrian mass on the sidewalk is gayer
of colour, more sentient&mdash;more companionable, more
understandably human.</p>

<p>It was in this weaving mass on the walk that the
communicants of St. Antipas were often refreshed by
the vision of their rector on pleasant afternoons. Here
the Reverend Doctor Linford loved to walk in God's
sunlight out of sheer simple joy in living&mdash;happily
undismayed by any possible consciousness that his
progress turned all faces to regard him, as inevitably
as one would turn the spokes of an endless succession
of turnstyles.</p>

<p>Habited with an obviously loving attention to detail,
yet with tasteful restraint, a precise and frankly confessed,
yet never obtrusive, elegance, bowing with a
manner to those of his flock favoured by heaven to
meet him, superbly, masculinely handsome, he was far
more than a mere justification of the pride St. Antipas
felt in him. He was a splendid inspiration to belief
in God and man.</p>

<p>Nor was he of the type Pharasaic&mdash;the type to profess
love for its kind, yet stay scrupulously aloof from the
vanquished and court only the victors. Indeed, this
was not so.</p>

<p>In the full tide of his progress&mdash;it was indeed a
progress and never a mere walk&mdash;he would stop to
address a few words of simple cheer to the aged female
mendicant&mdash;perhaps to make a joke with her&mdash;some
pleasantry not unbefitting his station, his mien denoting
a tender chivalry which has been agreeably subdued
though not impaired by the experience inevitable to
a man of the world. When he dropped the coin into
the withered palm, he did it with a certain lingering
hurriedness, as one frankly unable to repress a human
weakness, though nervously striving to have it over
quickly and by stealth.</p>

<p>Young Rigby Reeves, generalising, as it later appeared,
from inadequate data, swore once that the
rector of St. Antipas kept always an eye ahead for the
female mendicant in the tattered shawl and the bonnet
of inferior modishness; that, if the Avenue was crowded
enough to make it seem worth while, he would even
cross from one side to the other for the sake of speaking
to her publicly.</p>

<p>While the fact so declared may have been a fact,
the young man's corollary that the rector of St. Antipas
sought this experience for the sake of its mere publicity
came from a prejudice which closer acquaintance with
Dr. Linford happily dissolved from his mind. As
reasonably might he have averred, as did another cynic,
that the rector of St. Antipas was actuated by the instincts
of a mountebank when he selected his evening
papers each day&mdash;deliberately and with kind words&mdash;
from the stock of a newswoman at a certain conspicuous
and ever-crowded crossing. As reasonable was the
imputation of this other cynic, that in greeting friends
upon the thronged avenue, the rector never failed to
use some word or phrase that would identify him to
those passing, giving the person addressed an unpleasant
sense of being placed in a lime-light, yet reducing
him to an insignificance just this side the line of obliteration.</p>

<p>&quot;You say, 'Ah, Doctor!' and shake hands, you
know,&quot; said this hypercritical observer, &quot;and, ten to
one, he says something about St. Antipas directly, you
know, or&mdash;'Tell him to call on Dr. Linford at the rectory
adjoining St. Antipas&mdash;I'm always there at eleven,' or
'Yes, quite true, the bishop said to me, &quot;My dear Linford,
we depend on you in this matter,&quot;' or telling how
Mrs. General Somebody-Something, you know&mdash;I
never could remember names&mdash;took him down dreadfully
by calling him the most dangerously fascinating
man in New York. And there you are, you know!
It never fails, on my word! And all the time people
are passing and turning to stare and listen, you know,
so that it's quite rowdy&mdash;saying 'Yes&mdash;that's Linford&mdash;
there he is,' quite as if they were on one of those coaches
seeing New York; and you feel, by Jove, I give you my
word, like the solemn ass who goes up on the stage to
help the fellow do his tricks, you know, when he calls
for 'some kind gentleman from the audience.'&quot;</p>

<p>It may be told that this other person was of a cynicism
hopelessly indurated. Not so with Rigby Reeves,
even after Reeves alleged the other discoveries that
the rector of St. Antipas had &quot;a walk that would be a
strut, by gad! if he was as short as I am&quot;; also that he
&quot;walked like a parade,&quot; which, as expounded by Mr.
Reeves, meant that his air in walking was that of one
conscious always of leading a triumphal procession in
his own honour; and again, that one might read in his
eyes a keenly sensuous enjoyment in the tones of his
own voice; that he coloured these with a certain unction
corresponding to the flourishes with which people of a
certain obliquity of mind love to ornament their chirography;
still again that he, Reeves, was &quot;ready to lay
a bet that the fellow would continue to pose even at
the foot of the Great White Throne.&quot;</p>

<p>Happily this young man was won out of his carping
attitude by closer acquaintance with the rector of St.
Antipas, and learned to regard those things as no more
than the inseparable antennae of a nature unusually
endowed with human warmth and richness&mdash;mere
meaningless projections from a personality simple,
rugged, genuine, never subtle, and entirely likable.
He came to feel that, while the rector himself was unaffectedly
impressed by that profusion of gifts with which
it had pleased heaven to distinguish him, he was yet
constantly annoyed and embarrassed by the fact that
he was thus made so salient a man. Young Reeves
found him an appreciative person, moreover, one
who betrayed a sensible interest in a fellow's own
achievements, finding many reasons to be impressed by
a few little things in the way of athletics, travel, and
sport that had never seemed at all to impress the
many&mdash;not even the members of one's own family.
Rigby Reeves, indeed, became an ardent partisan of Dr.
Linford, attending services religiously with his mother
and sisters&mdash;and nearly making a row in the club caf&eacute;
one afternoon when the other and more obdurate cynic
declared, with a fine assumption of the judicial, that
Linford was &quot;the best actor in New York&mdash;on the
stage or off!&quot;</p>

<p>It was concerning this habit of the daily stroll that
Aunt Bell and her niece also disagreed one afternoon.
They were in the little dark-wooded, red-walled library
of the rectory, Aunt Bell with her book of devotion,
Nancy at her desk, writing.</p>

<p>From her low chair near the window, Aunt Bell had
just beheld the Doctor's erect head, its hat of flawless
gloss, and his beautifully squared shoulders, progress
at a moderate speed across her narrow field of vision.
In so stiffly a level line had they passed that a profane
thought seized her unawares: the fancy that the rector
of St. Antipas had been pulled by the window on rollers.
But this was at once atoned for. She observed that
Allan was one of the few men who walk always like
those born to rule. Then she spoke:</p>

<p>&quot;Nancy, why do you never walk with Allan in the
afternoon? Nothing would please him better&mdash;the
boy is positively proud to have you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I had to finish this letter to Clara,&quot; Nancy
answered abstractedly, as if still intent upon her writing,
debating a word with narrowed eyes and pen-tip at
her teeth.</p>

<p>But Aunt Bell was neither to be misunderstood nor
insufficiently answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Not this afternoon, especially&mdash;<i>any</i> afternoon. I
can't remember when you've walked with him. So
many times I've heard you refuse&mdash;and I dare say it
doesn't please him, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he has often told me so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Bell&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, <i>you've</i> walked on the street
with Allan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure I have!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;of course&mdash;that <i>is</i> true in a way&mdash;Allan <i>does</i>
attract attention the moment he reaches the pavement&mdash;
and of course every one stares at one&mdash;but it isn't the
poor fellow's fault. At least, if the boy were at all
conscious of it he might in very little ways here and
there prevent the very tiniest bit of it&mdash;but, my dear,
your husband is a man of most striking appearance&mdash;
especially in the clerical garb&mdash;even on that avenue
over there where striking persons abound&mdash;and it's
not to be helped. And I can't wonder he's not pleased
with you when it gives him such pleasure to have a
modish and handsome young woman at his side. I
met him the other day walking down from Forty-second
Street with that stunning-looking Mrs. Wyeth,
and he looked as happy and bubbling as a schoolboy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&mdash;Aunt Bell&mdash;but of course, if you don't see, I
couldn't possibly tell you.&quot; She turned suddenly to
her letter, as if to dismiss the hopeless task.</p>

<p>Now Aunt Bell, being entirely human, would not
keep silence under an intimation that her powers of
discernment were less than phenomenal. The tone of
her reply, therefore, hinted of much.</p>

<p>&quot;My child&mdash;I may see and gather and understand
much more than I give any sign of.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a wretchedly empty boast. Doubtless it had
never been true of Aunt Bell at any time in her life,
but she was nettled now: one must present frowning
fortifications at a point where one is attacked, even if
they be only of pasteboard. Then, too, a random
claim to possess hidden fruits of observation is often
productive. Much reticence goes down before it.</p>

<p>Nancy turned to her again with a kind of relief in
her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Bell, I was sure of it&mdash;I couldn't tell you,
but I was sure you must see!&quot; Her pen was thrown
aside and she drooped in her chair, her hands listless
in her lap.</p>

<p>Aunt Bell looked sympathetically voluble but wisely
refrained from speech.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; continued the girl, &quot;if you knew at the
time, the time when my eyes seemed to open&mdash;when I
was deceived by his pretension into thinking&mdash;you
remember that first sermon, Aunt Bell&mdash;how independent
and noble I thought it was going to be. Oh,
Aunt Bell&mdash;what a slump in my faith that day! I
think its foundations all went, and then naturally the
rest of it just seemed to topple. Did you realise it all
the time?&quot;</p>

<p>So it was religious doubt&mdash;a loss of faith&mdash;heterodoxy?
Having listened until she gathered this much,
Aunt Bell broke in&mdash;&quot;My dear, you must let me guide
you in this. You know what I've been through.
Study the higher criticism, reverently, if you will&mdash;
even broaden into the higher unbelief. Times have
changed since my youth; one may broaden into almost
anything now and still be orthodox, especially in our
church. But beware of the literal mind, the material
view of things. Remember that the essentials of
Christianity are spiritually historic even if they aren't
materially historic&mdash;facts in the human consciousness
if not in the world of matter. You need not pretend
to understand how God can be one in essence and three
in person&mdash;I grant you that is only a reversion to polytheism
and is so regarded by the best Biblical scholars&mdash;
but never surrender your belief in the atoning blood of
the Son whom He sent a ransom for many&mdash;at least as
a spiritual fact. I myself have dismissed the Trinity
as one of those mysteries to be adoringly believed on
earth and comprehended only in heaven&mdash;but that
God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
Son&mdash;Child, do you think I could look forward without
fear to facing God, if I did not believe that the blood
of his only begotten Son had washed from my soul
that guilt of the sin I committed in Adam? Cling to
these simple essentials, and otherwise broaden even
into the higher unbelief, if you like&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Aunt Bell, it <i>isn't</i> that! I never trouble about
those things&mdash;though you have divined truly that I have
doubted them lately&mdash;but the doubts don't distress me.
Actually, Aunt Bell, for a woman to lose faith in her
God seems a small matter beside losing faith in her
husband. You can doubt and reason and speculate
and argue about the first&mdash;it's fashionable&mdash;people
rather respect unbelievers nowadays&mdash;but Oh, Aunt
Bell, how the other hurts!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, my child&mdash;my preposterous child! How can
you have lost faith in that husband of yours? What
nonsense! Do you mean you have taken seriously
those harmless jesting little sallies of his about the
snares and pitfalls of a clergyman's life, or his tales of
how this or that silly woman has allowed him to detect
in her that pure reverence which most women do feel
for a clergyman, whether he's handsome or not? Take
Mrs. Wyeth, for example&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Aunt Bell&mdash;no, no&mdash;how can you think&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I admit Allan is the least bit&mdash;er&mdash;redundant of
those anecdotes&mdash;perhaps just the least bit insistent
about the snares and pitfalls that beset an attractive
man in his position. But really, my dear&mdash;I know
men&mdash;and you need never feel a twinge of jealousy.
For one thing, Allan would be held in bounds by fear of
the world, even if his love for you were inadequate to
hold him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no use trying to make you understand, Aunt
Bell&mdash;you <i>can't!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon Aunt Bell neglected her former device of
pretending that she did, indeed, understand, and bluntly
asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what is it, child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, nothing, nothing, Aunt Bell&mdash;it's only
what he <i>is</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What he <i>is</i>? A handsome, agreeable, healthy,
good-tempered, loyal, upright, irreproachable&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Bell, he's <i>killing</i> me. I seem to want to laugh
when I tell you, because it's so funny that he should
have the power to&mdash;but I tell you he's killing out all the
good in me&mdash;a little bit every day. I can't even <i>want</i>
to be good. Oh, how stupid to think you could see&mdash;
that any one could see! Sometimes I do forget and
laugh all at once. It's as grotesque and unreal as an
imaginary monster I used to be afraid of&mdash;then I'm
sick, for I remember we are bound together by the laws
of God and man. Of course, you can't see, Aunt Bell&mdash;
the fire hasn't eaten through yet&mdash;but I tell you it's
burning inside day and night.&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed a little, as if to reassure her puzzled
listener.</p>

<p>&quot;A fire eating away inside, Aunt Bell&mdash;burning out
my goodness&mdash;if the firemen would only come with
engines and axes and hooks and things, and water&mdash;
I'd submit to being torn apart as meekly as any old
house&mdash;it hurts so!&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Apple of Doubt Is Nibbled</h3>

<p>The rector of St. Antipas came from preaching his
Easter sermon. He was elated. Of the sermons delivered
in New York that morning, he suspected that his
would be found not the least ingenious. Telling
excerpts would doubtless appear in the next day's
papers, and at least one paper would reprint his favourite
likeness over the caption, &quot;Dr. Allan Delcher Linford,
the Handsome and Up-to-Date Rector of St. Antipas.&quot;
Under this would be head-lines: &quot;The Resurrection
Proved; a Literal Fact in History not less than a Spiritual
Fact in the Human Consciousness. An Unbroken
Chain of Living Witnesses.&quot;</p>

<p>He even worded scraps of the article on his way from
the church to his study:</p>

<p>&quot;An unusually rich Easter service was held at fashionable
St. Antipas yesterday morning. The sermon by
its able and handsome young rector, the Reverend Dr.
Linford, was fraught with vital interest to every thinking
man. The Resurrection he declares to be a fact as
well attested as the Brooklyn Bridge is to thousands
who have never seen it&mdash;yet who are convinced of its
existence upon the testimony of those who have. Thus
one who has never seen this bridge may be as certain of
its existence as a man who crosses it twice a day. In
the same way, a witness to the risen Christ tells the
glorious truth to his son, a lad of fifteen, who at eighty
tells it to his grandson. 'Do you realise,' said the
magnetic young preacher, 'that the assurance of the
Resurrection comes to you this morning by word of
mouth through a scant three thousand witnesses&mdash;a
living chain of less than three thousand links by which
we may trace our steps back to the presence of the first
witness&mdash;so that, in effect, we have the Resurrection
on the word of a man who beheld the living Saviour this
very morning? Nay; further, in effect we ourselves
stand trembling before that stone rolled away from the
empty but forever hallowed tomb. As certainly as
thousands know that a structure called the Brooklyn
Bridge exists, so upon testimony of the same validity
do we know that &quot;God so loved the world that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed on him
might not perish but have everlasting life.&quot; God has
not expected us to trust blindly: he has presented tangible
and compelling evidence of his glorious scheme
of salvation.' The speaker, who is always imbued with
the magnetism of a striking personality, was more than
usually effective on this occasion, and visibly moved the
throng of fashionable worshippers that&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Allan, you outdid yourself!&quot; Aunt Bell had come
in and, in the mirror over the dining-room mantel, was
bestowing glances of unaffected but strictly impartial
admiration upon the bonnet of lilac blossoms that
rested above the lustrous puffs of her plenteous gray
hair.</p>

<p>The young man looked up from his meditative pacing
of the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Bell, I think I may say that I pleased myself
this morning&mdash;and you know that's not easy for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's too bad Nance wasn't there!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nancy is not pleasing me,&quot; began her husband, in
gentle tones.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't feel equal to it, Allan,&quot; his wife called from
the library.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you're there! My dear, you give up too easily
to little indispositions that another woman would make
nothing of. I've repeated that to you so often that,
really, your further ignoring it appears dangerously like
perverseness&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is she crying?&quot; he asked Aunt Bell, as they both
listened.</p>

<p>&quot;Laughing!&quot; replied that lady.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear, may I ask if you are laughing at me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear, no!&mdash;only at something I happened to think
of.&quot; She came into the dining-room, a morning paper
in her hand. &quot;Besides, in to-morrow's paper I
shall read all about what the handsome rector of St.
Antipas said, in his handsome voice, to his handsome
hearers&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He had frowned at first, but now smiled indulgently,
as they sat down to luncheon. &quot;You <i>will</i> have your
joke about my appearance, Nance! That reminds
me&mdash;that poor romantic little Mrs. Eversley&mdash;sister of
Mrs. Wyeth, you know&mdash;said to me after service this
morning, 'Oh, Dr. Linford, if I could only believe in
Christian dogma as I believe in <i>you</i> as a man!' You
know, she's such a painfully emotional, impulsive
creature, and then Colonel Godwin who stood by had
to have <i>his</i> joke: 'The symbol will serve you for worship,
Madam!' he says; 'I'm sure no woman's soul
would ever be lost if all clergymen were as good to look
upon as our friend here!' Those things always make
me feel so awkward&mdash;they are said so bluntly&mdash;but
what could I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Browett's sister and her son were out with him
this morning,&quot; began Aunt Bell, charitably entering
another channel of conversation from the intuition
that her niece was wincing. But, as not infrequently
happened, the seeming outlet merely gave again into
the main channel.</p>

<p>&quot;And there's Browett,&quot; continued the Doctor. &quot;Now
I am said to have great influence over women&mdash;women
trust me, believe me&mdash;I may even say look up to me&mdash;
but I pledge you my word I am conscious of wielding an
immensely greater influence over men. There seems
to be in my <i>ego</i> the power to prevail. Take Browett&mdash;
most men are afraid of him&mdash;not physical fear, but their
inner selves, their <i>egos</i>, go down before him. Yet from
the moment I first saw that man I dominated him. It's
all in having an <i>ego</i> that means mastery, Aunt Bell.
Browett has it himself, but I have a greater one. Every
time Browett's eyes meet mine he knows in his soul that
I'm his master&mdash;his <i>ego</i> prostrates itself before mine&mdash;
and yet that man&quot;&mdash;he concluded in a tone of distinguishable
awe&mdash;&quot;is worth all the way from two to
three hundred millions!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Eversley is an unlucky little woman, from what
I hear,&quot; began Aunt Bell, once more with altruistic aims.</p>

<p>&quot;That reminds me,&quot; said the Doctor, recalling himself
from a downward look at the grovelling Browett,
&quot;she made me promise to be in at four o'clock. Really
I couldn't evade her&mdash;it was either four o'clock to-day
or the first possible day. What could I do? Aunt
Bell, I won't pretend that this being looked up to and
sought out is always disagreeable. Contrary to the
Pharisee, I say 'Thank God I <i>am</i> as other men are!' I
have my human moments, but mostly it bores me, and
especially these half-religious, half-sentimental confidences
of emotional women who imagine their lives
are tragedies. Now this woman believes her marriage
is unhappy&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, it is!&quot; Aunt Bell broke in&mdash;this time effectually,
for she proceeded to relate of one Morris Upton
Eversley a catalogue of inelegancies that, if authoritative,
left him, considered as a husband, undesirable, not to
say impracticable. His demerits, indeed, served to
bring the meal to a blithe and chatty close.</p>

<p>Aunt Bell's practice each day after luncheon was, in
her own terminology, to &quot;go into the silence and concentrate
upon the thought of the All-Good.&quot; She was
recalled from the psychic state on this afternoon, though
happily not before a good half-hour, by Nancy's knock
at her door.</p>

<p>She came in, cheerful, a small sheaf of papers in her
hand. Aunt Bell, finding herself restored and amiable,
sat up to listen.</p>

<p>Nancy threw herself on the couch, with the air of a
woman about to chat confidentially from the softness
of many gay pillows, dropping into the attitude of tranquil
relaxation that may yet bristle with eager mental
quills.</p>

<p>&quot;The drollest thing, Aunt Bell! This morning
instead of hearing Allan, I went up to that trunk-room
and rummaged through the chest that has all
those old papers and things of Grandfather Delcher's.
And would you believe it? For an hour or more
there, I was reading bits of his old sermons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he was a Presbyterian!&quot; In her tone and
inflection Aunt Bell ably conveyed an exposition of the
old gentleman's impossibility&mdash;lucidly allotting him to
spiritual fellowship with the head-hunters of Borneo.</p>

<p>&quot;I know it, but, Aunt Bell, those old sermons really
did me good; all full of fire they were, too, but you felt
a <i>man</i> back of them&mdash;a good man, a real man. You
liked him, and it didn't matter that his terminology
was at times a little eccentric. Grandfather's theology
fitted the last days of his life about as crinoline and
hoop-skirts would fit over there on the avenue to-day&mdash;
but he always made me feel religious. It seemed sweet
and good to be a Christian when he talked. With all
his antiquated beliefs he never made me doubt as&mdash;as
I doubt to-day. But it was another thing I wanted to
show you&mdash;something I found&mdash;some old compositions
of Bernal's that his grandfather must have kept.
Here's one about birds&mdash;'jingle-birds, squeak-birds and
clatter-birds.' No?&mdash;you wouldn't care for that?&mdash;
well&mdash;listen to this.&quot;</p>

<p>She read the youthful Bernal's effort to rehabilitate
the much-blemished reputation of Judas&mdash;a paper that
had been curiously preserved by the old man.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Judas, indeed!&quot; The novelty was not lost
upon Aunt Bell, expert that she was in all obliquities
from accepted tradition.</p>

<p>&quot;The funny boy! Very ingenious, I'm sure. I dare
say no one ever before said a good word for Judas since
the day of his death, and this lad would canonise him
out of hand. Think of it&mdash;St. Judas!&quot;</p>

<p>Nancy lay back among the cushions, talking idly,
inconsequently.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, there was at least one man created, Aunt
Bell, who could by no chance be saved&mdash;one man who
had to betray the Son of Man&mdash;one man to be forever
left out of the Christian scheme of salvation, even if
every other in the world were saved. There had to be
one man to disbelieve, to betray and to lie in hell for it,
or the whole plan would have been frustrated. There
was a theme for Dante, Aunt Bell&mdash;not the one soul in
hell, but the other souls in heaven slowly awakening to
the suffering of that one soul&mdash;to the knowledge that
he was suffering in order that they might be saved. Do
you think they would find heaven to be real heaven if
they knew he was burning? And don't you think a
poet could make some interesting talk between this
solitary soul predestined to hell, and the God who
planned the scheme?&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell looked bored and uttered a swift, low phrase
that might have been &quot;Fiddlesticks!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear, no one believes in hell nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does any one believe in anything?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Belief in the essentials of Christianity was never
more apparent.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a treasured phrase from the morning's sermon.</p>

<p>&quot;What are the essentials?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Belief that God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten Son&mdash;you know as well as I, child&mdash;belief
in the atoning blood of the Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't it be awful, Aunt Bell, if you didn't
believe in it, and had to be in hell because the serpent
persuaded Eve and Eve persuaded Adam to eat the
apple&mdash;that's the essential foundation of Christianity,
isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, certainly&mdash;you must believe in original sin&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see&mdash;here's a note in Bernal's hand, on one of
these old papers&mdash;evidently written much later than the
other: 'The old gentleman says Christmas is losing its
deeper significance. What is it? That the Babe of
Bethlehem was begotten by his Father to be a sacrifice
to its Father&mdash;that its blood might atone for the sin of
his first pair&mdash;and so save from eternal torment the offspring
of that pair. God will no longer be appeased
by the blood of lambs; nothing but the blood of his son
will now atone for the sin of his own creatures. It
seems to me the sooner Christmas loses this deeper significance
the better. Poor old loving human nature
gives it a much more beautiful significance.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear,&quot; began Aunt Bell, &quot;before I broadened
into what I have called the higher unbelief, I should
have considered that that young man had a positive
genius for blasphemy; now that I have again come into
the shadow of the cross, it seems to me that he merely
lacks imagination.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Bernal! Yet he made me believe, though he
seemed to believe in nothing himself. He makes me
believe <i>now</i>. He <i>calls</i> to me, Aunt Bell&mdash;or is it myself
calling to him that I hear?</p>

<p>&quot;And blasphemy&mdash;even the word is ridiculous, Aunt
Bell. I was at the day-nursery yesterday when all
those babies were brought in to their dinner. They
are strictly forbidden to coo or to make any noise, and
they really behaved finely for two-and three-year-olds
&mdash;though I did see one outlaw reach over before
the signal was given and lovingly pat the big fat
cookie beside its plate&mdash;thinking its insubordination
would be overlooked&mdash;but, Aunt Bell, do you
suppose one of those fifty-two babies could blaspheme
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be silly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But can you imagine one of them capable of any
disrespect to you that would merit&mdash;say, burning or
something severe like that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, don't you really believe that God is farther
beyond you or me or the foolish boy that wrote this, than
we are beyond those babies&mdash;with a greater, bigger
point of view, a fuller love? Imagine the God that
made everything&mdash;the worlds and birds and flowers
and butterflies and babies and mountains&mdash;imagine
him feeling insulted because one of his wretched little
John Smiths or Bernal Linfords babbles little human
words about him, or even worries his poor little human
heart with doubts of His existence!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My child, yours is but a finite mind, unable to limit
or define the Infinite. What is it, anyway&mdash;is it Christian
Science taking hold of you, or that chap who preaches
that they have the Messiah re-incarnated and now living
in Syria&mdash;Babbists, aren't they&mdash;or is it theosophy&mdash;
or are you simply dissatisfied with Allan?&quot; A sudden
shrewd glance from Aunt Bell's baby-blue eyes went
with this last.</p>

<p>Nancy laughed, then grew serious. &quot;I think the last
is it, Aunt Bell. A woman seems to doubt God and
everything else after she begins to doubt the husband
she has loved. Really, I find myself questioning everything
&mdash;every moral standard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nance, you are an ungrateful woman to speak like
that of Allan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never should have done it, dear, if you hadn't made
me believe you knew. I should have thought it out all
by myself, and then acted, if I found I could with any
conscience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Mercy! You couldn't. The <i>idea!</i> And
there's Allan, now. Come!&quot;</p>

<p>The Doctor was on the threshold. &quot;So here you are!
Well, I've just sent Mrs. Eversley away in tears.&quot;</p>

<p>He dropped into an arm-chair with a little half-humorous
moan of fatigue.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a relief, sometimes, to know you can relax and
let your whole weight absolutely down on to the broad
earth!&quot; he declared.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Eversley?&quot; suggested Aunt Bell.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the short of it is, she told me her woes
and begged me to give my sanction to her securing a divorce!&quot;</p>

<p>Nancy sat up from her pillows. &quot;Oh&mdash;and you
<i>did?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Nancy!</i>&quot; It was low, but clear, quick-spoken,
stern, and hurt. &quot;You forget yourself. At least you
forget my view and the view of my Church. Even
were I out of the Church, I should still regard marriage
as a sacrament&mdash;indissoluble except by death. The
 very words&mdash;'Whom God hath joined'&quot;&mdash;he became
 almost oratorical in his warmth&mdash;&quot;Surely you would
 not expect me to use my influence in this parish to undermine
 the sanctity of the home&mdash;to attack our emblem
 of Christ's union with His Church!&quot;</p>

<p>With reproach in his eyes&mdash;a reproach that in some
way seemed to be bland and mellow, yet with a hurt
droop to his handsome head, he went from the room.
Nancy looked after him, longingly, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&quot;The maddening thing is, Aunt Bell, that sometimes
he actually has the power to make me believe in
him. But, oh, doesn't Christ's union with his Church

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Sinful Perverseness of the Natural Woman</h3>

<p>Two months later a certain tension in the rectory of
St. Antipas was temporarily relieved. Like the spring
of a watch wound too tightly, it snapped one day at
Nancy's declaration that she would go to Edom for a
time&mdash;would go, moreover, without a reason&mdash;without
so much as a woman's easy &quot;because.&quot; This circumstance,
while it froze in the bud every available objection
to her course, quelled none of the displeasure that was
felt at her woman's perversity.</p>

<p>Her decision was announced one morning after a
sleepless night, and after she had behaved unaccountably
for three days.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not pleasing Allan,&quot; was Aunt Bell's masterly
way of putting the situation. Nancy laughed
from out of the puzzling reserve into which she had
lately settled.</p>

<p>&quot;So he tells me, Aunt Bell. He utters it with the air
of telling me something necessarily to my discredit&mdash;
yet I wonder whose fault it really is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of all things!&quot; Aunt Bell made no effort to
conceal her amazement.</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't necessarily mine, you know.&quot; Before the
mirror she brought the veil nicely about the edge of her
hat, with the strained and solemn absorption of a woman
in this shriving of her reflection so that it may go out in peace.</p>

<p>&quot;My failure to please Allan, you know, may as easily
be due to his defects as to mine. I said so, but he only
answered, 'Really, you're not pleasing me.' And, as
he often says of his own predicaments&mdash;'What could I
do?' But I'm glad he persists in it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, if you resent it so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because, Aunt Bell, I must be quite&mdash;<i>quite</i> certain
that Allan is funny. It would be dreadful to make a
mistake. If only I could be certain&mdash;positive&mdash;convinced&mdash;
sure&mdash;that Allan is the funniest thing in all the
world&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It never occurred to me that Allan is funny.&quot; Aunt
Bell paused for an instant's retrospect. &quot;Now, he
doesn't joke much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One doesn't have to joke to be a joke, Aunt Bell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what if he were funny? Why is that so important?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's important because of the other thing that
you know you know when you know that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy! Child, you should have a cup of cocoa or
something before you start off&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The last long hatpin seemingly pierced the head of
Nancy and she turned from the glass to fumble on her
gloves.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Bell, if Allan tells me once more in that hurt,
gentle tone that I don't please him, I believe I shall be
the freest of free women&mdash;ready to live.&quot;</p>

<p>She paused to look vacantly into the wall. &quot;Sometimes,
you know, I seem to wake up with a clear mind&mdash;
but the day clouds it. We shouldn't believe so many
falsities, Aunt Bell, if they didn't pinch our brains into
it at a tender age. I should know Allan through and
through at a glance to-day, if I met him for the first
time; but he kneaded my poor girl's brain this way and
that, till I'd have been done for, Aunt Bell, if some one
else hadn't kneaded and patted it into other ways, so
that little memories come back and stay with me&mdash;
little bits of sweetness and genuineness&mdash;of <i>realness</i>,
Aunt Bell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nance, you are morbid&mdash;and I think you're wrong
to go up there to be alone with your sick fancies&mdash;why
are you going, Nance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Bell, can I really trust you not to betray me?
Will you promise to keep the secret if I actually tell
you?&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell looked at once important and trustworthy,
yet of an incorruptible propriety.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure, my dear, you would not ask me to keep
secret anything that your husband would be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear, no! You can keep mum with a spotless conscience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course; I was sure of that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a fraud you are, Aunt Bell&mdash;you weren't sure
at all&mdash;but I shall disappoint you. Now my reason&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
She came close and spoke low&mdash;&mdash;&quot;My reason for
going to Edom, whatever it is, is so utterly silly that I
haven't even dared to tell myself&mdash;so, you see&mdash;my
<i>real</i> reason for going is simply to find out what my
reason really is. I'm dying to know. There! Now
never say I didn't trust you.&quot;</p>

<p>In the first shock of this fall from her anticipations
Aunt Bell neglected to remember that All is Good.
Yet she was presently far enough mollified to accompany
her niece to the station.</p>

<p>Returning from thence after she had watched Nancy
through the gate to the 3:05 Edom local, Aunt Bell
lingered at the open study door of the rector of St.
Antipas. He looked up cordially.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Allan, it may do the child good, after
all, to be alone a little while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nancy&mdash;has&mdash;not&mdash;pleased&mdash;me!&quot; The words
were clean-cut, with an illuminating pause after each,
so that Aunt Bell might by no chance mistake their
import, yet the tone was low and not without a quality
of winning sweetness&mdash;the tone of the injured good.</p>

<p>&quot;I've seen that, Allan. Nance undoubtedly has a
vein of selfishness. Instead of striving to please her
husband, she&mdash;well, she has practically intimated to
me that a wife has the right to please herself. Of
course, she didn't say it brutally in just those words,
but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's the modern spirit, Aunt Bell&mdash;the spirit of
unbelief. It has made what we call the 'new woman'
&mdash;that noxious flower on the stalk of scientific materialism.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned and wrote this phrase rapidly on a pad at
his elbow, while Aunt Bell waited expectantly for more.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a sermon that writes itself, Aunt Bell. '
Woman's deterioration under Modern Infidelity to
God.' As truly as you live, this thing called the 'new
woman' has grown up side by side with the thing called
the higher criticism. And it's natural. Take away
God's word as revealed in the Scriptures and you make
 woman a law unto herself. Man's state is then wretched
 enough, but contemplate woman's! Having put aside
 Christ's authority, she naturally puts aside <i>man's</i>, hence
 we have the creature who mannishly desires the suffrage
 and attends club meetings and argues, and has views&mdash;
 <i>views</i>, Aunt Bell, on the questions of the day&mdash;the
 woman who, as you have just succinctly said of your
 niece, 'believes she has a right to please herself!' There
 is the keynote of the modern divorce evil, Aunt Bell&mdash;
 she has a right to please herself. Believing no longer
 in God, she no longer feels bound by His commandment:
 'Wives be subject to your husbands!' Why,
 Aunt Bell, if you can imagine Christianity shorn of all
 its other glories, it would still be the greatest religion
 the world has ever known, because it holds woman
 sternly in her sphere and maintains the sanctity of the
 home. Now, I know nothing of the real state of Nancy's
 faith, but the fact that she believes she has a right
 to please herself is enough to convince me. I would
 stake my right arm this moment, upon just this evidence,
 that Nancy has become an unbeliever. When I
 let her know as plainly as English words can express it
 that she is not pleasing me, she looks either sullen or
 flippant&mdash;thus showing distinctly a loss of religious
 faith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ought to make a stunning sermon of that,
Allan. I think society needs it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It does, Aunt Bell, it does! And we are going from
bad to worse. I foresee the time in this very age of ours
when no woman will continue to be wife to a man
except by the dictates of her own lawless and corrupt
nature&mdash;when a wife will make so-called love her only
rule&mdash;when she will brazenly disregard the law of God
and the word of his only begotten crucified Son, unless
she can continue to feel what she calls 'love and respect'
for the husband who chose her. We prize liberty,
Aunt Bell, but liberty with woman has become license
since she lost faith in the word of God that holds her
subject to man. We should be thankful that the mother
Church still stands firm on that rock&mdash;the rock of
woman's subjection to man. Our own Church has
quibbled, Aunt Bell, but look at the fine consistency of
the Church of Rome. As truly as you live, the Catholic
Church will one day hold the only women who subject
themselves to their husbands in all things because of
God's command&mdash;regardless of their anarchistic desire
to 'please themselves.' There is the only Christian
Church left that knows woman is a creature to be ruled
with an iron hand&mdash;and has the courage to send them
to hell for 'pleasing themselves.'&quot;</p>

<p>He glowed in meditation a moment, then, in a burst
of confidence, continued:</p>

<p>&quot;This is not to be repeated, Aunt Bell, but I have
more than once questioned if I should always allow the
Anglo-Catholic Church to modify my true Catholicism.
I have talked freely with Father Riley of St. Clements
at our weekly ministers' meetings&mdash;there's a bright
chap for you&mdash;and really, Aunt Bell, as to mere universality,
the Church of Rome has about the only claim
worth considering. Mind you, this is not to be repeated,
but I am often so much troubled that I have to fall back
on my simple childish faith in the love of the Father
earned of him for me by the Son's death on the cross.
But what if I err in making my faith too simple? Even
now I am almost persuaded that a priest ordained into
the Episcopal Church cannot consecrate the elements
of the Eucharist in a sacrificial sense. Doubts like
these are tragedies to an honest man, Aunt Bell&mdash;they
try his soul&mdash;they bring him each day to the foot of that
cross whereon the Son of God suffers his agony in order
to ransom our souls from God's wrath with us&mdash;and
there are times, Aunt Bell, when I find myself gazing
longingly, like a little tired child, at the open arms of the
mother Church&mdash;on whose loving bosom of authority
a man may lay all his doubts and be never again troubled
in his mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell sighed cheerfully.</p>

<p>&quot;After all,&quot; she said briskly, &quot;isn't Christianity the
most fascinating of all beliefs, if one comes into it from
the higher unbelief? Isn't it fine, Allan&mdash;doesn't the
very thought excite you&mdash;that not only the souls of
thousands now living, but thousands yet unborn, will
be affected through all eternity for good or bad, by the
clearness with which you, here at this moment, perceive
and reason out these spiritual values&mdash;and the honesty
with which you act upon your conclusions. How truly
God has made us responsible for the souls of one
another!&quot;</p>

<p>The rector of St. Antipas shrugged modestly at this
bald wording of his responsibility; then he sighed and
bent his head as one honestly conscious of the situation's
gravity.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Reason of a Woman Who Had No Reason</h3>

<p>It was not a jest&mdash;Nancy's telling Aunt Bell that her
reason for going to Edom was too foolish to give even
to herself. At least such reticence to self is often sincerely
and plausibly asserted by the very inner woman.
Yet no sooner had her train started than her secret
within a secret began to tell itself: at first in whispers,
then low like a voice overheard through leafy trees;
then loud and louder until all the noise of the train
did no more than confuse the words so that only she could
hear them.</p>

<p>When the exciting time of this listening had gone and
she stepped from the train into the lazy spring silence
of the village, her own heart spelled the thing in quick,
loud, hammering beats&mdash;a thing which, now that she
faced it, was so wildly impossible that her cheeks
burned at the first second of actual realisation of its
enormity; and her knees weakened in a deathly tremble,
quite as if they might bend embarrassingly in either
direction.</p>

<p>Then in the outer spaces of her mind there grew, to
save her, a sense of her crass fatuity. She was quickly
in a carriage, eager to avoid any acquaintance, glad
the driver was no village familiar who might amiably
seek to regale her with gossip. They went swiftly up
the western road through its greening elms to where
Clytie kept the big house&mdash;her own home while she
lived, and the home of the family when they chose to go
there.</p>

<p>At last, the silent, cool house with its secretive green
shutters rose above her; the wheels made their little
crisping over the fine metal of the driveway. She hastily
paid the man and was at the side door that opened
into the sitting-room. As she put her hand to the knob
she was conscious of Clytie passing the window to open
the door.</p>

<p>Then they were face to face over the threshold&mdash;
Clytemnestra, of a matronly circumference, yet with
a certain prim consciousness of herself, which despite
the gray hair and the excellent maturity of her face,
was unmistakably maidenish&mdash;Clytie of the eyes always
wise to another's needs and beaming with that fine
wisdom.</p>

<p>She started back from the doorway by way of being
playfully dramatic&mdash;her hands on her hips, her head
to one side at an astounded angle. Yet little
more than a second did she let herself simulate this
welcoming incredulity&mdash;this stupefaction of cordiality.
There must be quick speech&mdash;especially as to Nancy's
face&mdash;which seemed strangely unfamiliar, set, suppressed,
breathless, unaccountably young&mdash;and there
had to be the splendid announcement of another
matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, child, is it you or your ghost?&quot;</p>

<p>Nancy could only nod her head.</p>

<p>&quot;My suz! what ails the child?&quot;</p>

<p>Here the other managed a shake of the head and a
made smile.</p>

<p>&quot;And of all things!&mdash;you'll never, never, never
guess!&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&mdash;there!&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;yes! I know&mdash;know all
about it&mdash;knew it&mdash;knew it last night&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She had put out a hand toward Clytie and now reached
the other from her side, easing herself to the doorpost
against which she leaned and laughed, weakly,
vacantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Some one told you&mdash;on the way up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;I knew it, I tell you&mdash;that's what makes it so
funny and foolish&mdash;why I came, you know&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She
had now gained a little in coherence, and with it came
a final doubt. She steadied herself in the doorway to
ask&mdash;&quot;When did Bernal come?&quot;</p>

<p>And Clytie, somewhat relieved, became voluble.</p>

<p>&quot;Night before last on the six-fifteen, and me getting
home late from the Epworth meeting&mdash;fire out&mdash;not a
stick of kindling-wood in&mdash;only two cakes in the buttery,
neither of them a layer&mdash;not a frying-size chicken
on the place&mdash;thank goodness he didn't have the appetite
he used to&mdash;though in another way it's just
downright heartbreaking to see a person you care for
not be a ready eater&mdash;but I had some of the plum
jell he used to like, and the good half of an apple-John
which I at once het up&mdash;and I sent Mehitty Lykins
down for some chops&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p>There had seemed to be a choking in the question.
Clytie regarded her curiously.</p>

<p>&quot;He was lying down up in the study a while ago&mdash;
kicking one foot up in the air against the wall, with his
head nearly off the sofy onto the floor, just like he
used to&mdash;there&mdash;that's his step&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't see him now! Here&mdash;let me go into your
room till I freshen and rest a bit&mdash;quick&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Once more the indecisive knees seemed about to
bend either way under their burden. With an effort
of will she drew the amazed Clytie toward the
open door of the latter's bedroom, then closed it
quickly, and stood facing her in the dusk of the
curtained room.</p>

<p>&quot;Clytie&mdash;I'm weak&mdash;it's so strange&mdash;actually weak&mdash;
I shake so&mdash;Oh, Clytie&mdash;I've got to cry!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a mutual opening of arms and a head on
Clytie's shoulder, wet eyes close in a corner that had
once been the good woman's neck&mdash;and stifling sobs
that seemed one moment to contract her body rigidly
from head to foot&mdash;the next to leave it limp and falling.
From the nursing shoulder she was helped to the bed,
though she could not yet relax her arms from that
desperate grip of Clytie's neck. Long she held her so,
even after the fit of weeping passed, clasping her with
arms in which there was almost a savage intensity&mdash;
arms that locked themselves more fiercely at any little
stirring of the prisoned one.</p>

<p>At last, when she had lain quiet a long time, the
grasp was suddenly loosened and Clytie was privileged
to ease her aching neck and cramped shoulders. Then,
even as she looked down, she heard from Nancy the
measured soft breathing of sleep. She drew a curtain
to shut out one last ray of light, and went softly from
the room.</p>

<p>Two hours later, as Clytemnestra attained ultimate
perfection in the arrangement of four glass dishes of
preserves and three varieties of cake upon her table&mdash;
for she still kept to the sinfully complex fare of the good
old simple days&mdash;Nancy came out. Clytie stood erect
to peer anxiously over the lamp at her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm all right&mdash;you were a dear to let me sleep.
See how fresh I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do look pearter, child&mdash;but you look different
from when you came. My suz! you looked so excited
and kind of young when I opened that door, it give me
a start for a minute&mdash;I thought I'd woke out of a dream
and you was a Miss in short skirts again. But now&mdash;
let me see you closer.&quot; She came around the table,
then continued: &quot;Well, you look fresh and sweet and
some rested, and you look old and reasonable again&mdash;
I mean as old as you had ought to look. I never did
know you to act that way before, child. My neck ain't
got the crick out of it yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor old Clytie&mdash;but you see yesterday all day I
felt queer&mdash;very queer, and wrought up, and last night
I couldn't rest, and I lay awake and excited all night&mdash;
and something seemed to give way when I saw you in
the door. Of course it was nervousness, and I shall
be all right now&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She looked up and saw Bernal staring at her&mdash;
standing in the doorway of the big room, his face
shading into the dusk back of him. She went to him
with both hands out and he kissed her.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it Nance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know&mdash;but it's really Bernal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Clytie says you knew I had come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Clytie must have misunderstood. No one even
intimated such a thing. I came up to-day&mdash;I had to
come&mdash;because&mdash;if I had known you were here,
wouldn't I have brought Allan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I was going to let you know, and come
down in a few days&mdash;there was some business to do
here. Dear old Allan! I'm aching to get a stranglehold
on him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;he'll be so glad&mdash;there's so much to say!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know whom I should find here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've had Clytie look after both houses&mdash;sometimes
we've rented mine&mdash;and almost every summer
we've come here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know I didn't dream I was rich until I got
here. The lawyer says they've advertised, but I've
been away from everything most of the time&mdash;not
looking out for advertisements. I can't understand
the old gentleman, when I was such a reprobate
and Allan was always such a thoroughly decent
chap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, hardly a reprobate!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Worse, Nance&mdash;an ass&mdash;think of my talking to that
dear old soul as I did&mdash;taking twenty minutes off to
win him from his lifelong faith. I shudder when I
remember it. And yet I honestly thought he might
be made to see things my way.&quot;</p>

<p>Their speech had been quick, and her eyes were
fastened upon his with a look from the old days striving
in her to bring back that big moment of their last parting
&mdash;that singular moment when they blindly groped for
each other but had perforce to be content with one
poor, trembling handclasp! Had that trembling been
a weakness or a strength? For all time since&mdash;and
increasingly during the later years&mdash;secret memories
of it had wonderfully quickened a life that would otherwise
have tended to fall dull, torpid, stubborn. It was
not that their hands had met, but that they had trembled
&mdash;those two strange hands that had both repelled
and coerced each other&mdash;faltering at last into that long
moment of triumphant certainty.</p>

<p>Under the first light words with Bernal this memory
had welled up anew in her with a mighty power before
which she was as a leaf in the wind. Then, all at once,
she saw that they had become dazed and speechless
above this present clasp&mdash;the yielding, yet opposing,
of those all-knowing, never-forgetting hands. There
followed one swift mutual look of bewilderment. Then
their hands fell apart and with little awkward laughs
they turned to Clytie.</p>

<p>They were presently at table, Clytie in a trance of
ecstatic watchfulness for emptied plates, broken only
by reachings and urgings of this or that esteemed fleshpot.</p>

<p>Under the ready talk that flowed, Nancy had opportunity
to observe the returned one. And now his
strangeness vaguely hurt her. The voice and the face
were not those that had come to secret life in her heart
during the years of his absence. Here was not the
laughing boy she had known, with his volatile, Lucifer-like
charm of light-hearted recklessness in the face of
destiny. Instead, a thinned, shy face rose before her,
a face full of awkwardness and dreaming, troubled and
absent; a face that one moment appealed by its defenseless
forgetfulness, and the next, coerced by a look eloquent
of tested strength.</p>

<p>As she watched him, there were two of her: one, the
girl dreaming forward out of the past, receptive of one
knew not what secrets from inner places; the other,
the vivid, alert woman&mdash;listening, waiting, judging.
She it was whose laugh came often to make of her face
the perfect whole out of many little imperfections.</p>

<p>Later, when they sat in the early summer night, under
a moon blurred to a phantom by the mist, when the
changed lines of his face were no longer relentless and
they two became little more than voices and remembered
presences to each other, she began to find him
indeed unchanged. Even his voice had in an hour
curiously lost that hurting strangeness. As she listened
she became absent, almost drowsy with memories of
that far night when his voice was quite the same and
their hands had trembled together&mdash;with such prescience
that through all the years her hand was to feel
the groping of his.</p>

<p>Yet awkward enough was that first half-hour of
their sitting side by side in the night, on the wide piazza
of his old home. Before them the lawn stretched
unbroken to the other big house, where Nancy had
wondered her way to womanhood. Empty now it was,
darkened as those years of her dreaming girlhood must
be to the present. Should she enter it, she knew the
house would murmur with echoes of other days; there
would be the wraith of the girl she once was flitting as
of old through its peopled rooms.</p>

<p>And out there actually before her was the stretch of
lawn where she had played games of tragic pretense
with the imperious, dreaming boy. Vividly there came
back that late afternoon when the monster of Bernal's
devising had frightened them for the last time&mdash;when
in a sudden flash of insight they had laughed the thing
away forever and faced each other with a certain half-joyous,
half-foolish maturity of understanding. One
day long after this she had humorously bewailed to
Bernal the loss of their child's faith in the Gratcher.
He had replied that, as an institution, the Gratcher was
imperishable&mdash;that it was brute humanity's instinctive
negation to the incredible perfections of life; that while
the child's Gratcher was not the man's, the latter was
yet of the same breed, however it might be refined by
the subtleties of maturity: that the man, like the child,
must fashion some monster of horror to deter him
when he hears God's call to live.</p>

<p>She had not been able to understand, nor did she
now. She was looking out to the two trees where once
her hammock had swung&mdash;to the rustic chair, now falling
apart from age, from which Bernal had faced her
that last evening. Then with a start she was back in
the present. Nancy of the old days must be shut fat
in the old house. There she might wander and wonder
endlessly among the echoes and the half-seen faces, but
never could she come forth; over the threshold there
could pass only the wife of Allan Linford.</p>

<p>Quick upon this realisation came a sharp fear of the
man beside her&mdash;a fear born of his hand's hold upon
hers when they had met. She shrank under the memory
of it, with a sudden instinct of the hunted. Then
from her new covert of reserve she dared to peer cautiously
at him, seeking to know how great was her peril
&mdash;to learn what measure of defense would best insure
her safety&mdash;recognising fearfully the traitor in her own
heart.</p>

<p>Their first idle talk had died, and she noted with new
alarm that they had been silent for many minutes.
This could not safely be&mdash;this insidious, barrier-destroying
silence. She seemed to hear his heart beating
high from his own sense of peril. But would he
help her? Would he not rather side with that wretched
traitor within her, crying out for the old days&mdash;would
he not still be the proud fool who would suffer no man's
law but his own? She shivered at the thought of his
nearness&mdash;of his momentous silence&mdash;of his treacherous
ally.</p>

<p>She stirred in her chair to look in where Clytie bustled
between kitchen and dining-room. Her movement
aroused him from his own abstraction. For a
breathless stretch of time she was frozen to inertness by
sheer terror. Would that old lawless spirit utter new
blasphemies, giving fearful point to them now? Would
the old eager hand come again upon hers with a boy's
pleading and a man's power? And what of her own
secret guilt? She had cherished the memory of him and
across space had responded to him through that imperious
need of her heart. Swiftly in this significant
moment she for the first time saw herself with critical
eyes&mdash;saw that in her fancied security she had unwittingly
enthroned the hidden traitor. More and more
poignant grew her apprehension as she felt his eyes
upon her and divined that he was about to speak. With
a little steadying of the lips, with eyes that widened at
him in the dim light, she waited for the sound of his
voice&mdash;waited as one waits for something &quot;terrible and
dear&quot;&mdash;the whirlwind that might destroy utterly, or
pass&mdash;to leave her forever exulting in a new sense of
power against elemental forces.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you mind if I smoked, Nance?&quot;</p>

<p>She stared stupidly. So tense had been her strain
that the words were mere meaningless blows that left her
quivering. He thought she had not heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you mind my pipe&mdash;and this very mild
mixture?&quot;</p>

<p>She blessed him for the respite.</p>

<p>&quot;Smoke, of course!&quot; she managed to say.</p>

<p>She watched him closely, still alert, as he stuffed the
tobacco into his pipe-bowl from a rubber pouch. Then
he struck the match and in that moment she suffered
another shock. The little flame danced out of the darkness,
and wavering, upward shadows played over a face
of utter quietness. The relaxed shoulders drooped sideways
in the chair, the body placidly sprawled, one
crossed leg gently waving. The shaded eye surveyed
some large and tranquil thought&mdash;and in that eye the
soul sat remote, aloof from her as any star.</p>

<p>She sank back in her chair with a long, stealthy
breath of relief&mdash;a relief as cold as stone. She had not
felt before that there was a chill in the wide sweetness of
the night. Now it wrapped her round and slowly,
with a soft brutality, penetrated to her heart.</p>

<p>The silence grew too long. With a shrugging effort
she surmounted herself and looked again toward the
alien figure looming unconcerned in the gloom. A
warm, super-personal sense of friendliness came upon
her. Her intellect awoke to inquiries. She began to
question him of his days away, and soon he was talking
freely enough, between pulls of his pipe.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Nance, I was a prodigal&mdash;only when I
awoke I had no father to go to. Poor grandad! What
a brutal cub I was! That has always stuck in my mind.
I was telling you about that cold wet night in Denver.
I had found a lodging in the police station. There
were others as forlorn&mdash;and Nance&mdash;did you ever realise
the buoyancy of the human mind? It's sublime.
We rejected ones sat there, warming ourselves, chatting,
and pretty soon one man found there were thirteen of us.
You would have thought that none of them could fear
bad luck&mdash;worse luck&mdash;none of them could have been
more dismally situated. But, do you know? most of
those fellows became nervous&mdash;as apprehensive of bad
luck as if they had been pampered princes in a time of
revolution. I was one of the two that volunteered to
restore confidence by bringing in another man.</p>

<p>&quot;We found an undersized, insignificant-looking chap
toddling aimlessly along the street a few blocks away
from the station. We grappled with him and hustled
him back to the crowd. He slept with us on the floor,
and no one paid any further attention to him, except
to remark that he talked to himself a good bit. He and
I awoke earliest next morning. I asked him if he was
hungry and he said he was. So I bought two fair breakfasts
with the money I'd saved for one good one, and we
started out of town. This chap said he was going that
way, and I had made up my mind to find a certain friend
of mine&mdash;a chap named Hoover. The second day out
I discovered that this queer man was the one who'd
been turning Denver upside down for ten days, healing
the halt and the blind. He was running away because
he liked a quieter life.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped, laughing softly, as if in remembrance&mdash;
until she prompted him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he said, 'Father' had commanded him to go
into the wilderness to fast. He was always talking
familiarly with 'Father,' as we walked. So I stayed
by him longer than I meant to&mdash;he seemed so helpless&mdash;
and I happened at that time to be looking for the true
God.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you find him, Bernal?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this strange man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In myself. It's the same old secret, Nance, that
people have been discovering for ages&mdash;but it is a secret
only until after you learn it for yourself. The only
true revelation from God is here in man&mdash;in the human
heart. I had to be years alone to find it out, Nance&mdash;
I'd had so much of that Bible mythology stuffed into
me&mdash;but I mustn't bore you with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but I must know, Bernal&mdash;you don't dream how
greatly I need at this moment to believe <i>something</i>&mdash;
more than you ever did!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's simple, Nance. It's the only revelation in
which the God of yesterday gives willing place to the
better God of to-day&mdash;only here does the God of to-day
say, 'Thou shalt have no other God before me but the
God of to-morrow who will be more Godlike than I.
Only in this way can we keep our God growing always
a little beyond us&mdash;so that to-morrow we shall not find
ourselves surpassing him as the first man you would meet
out there on the street surpasses the Christian God even
in the common virtues. That was the fourth dimension
of religion that I wanted, Nance&mdash;faith in a God
that a fearless man could worship.&quot;</p>

<p>He lighted his pipe again, and as the match blazed
up she saw the absent look still in his eyes. By it she
realised how far away from her he was&mdash;realised it
with a little sharp sense of desolation. He smoked
a while before speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Out there in the mountains, Nance, I thought about
these things a long time&mdash;the years went before I knew
it. At first I stayed with this healing chap, only after
a while he started back to teach again and they found
him dead. He believed he had a mission to save the
world, and that he would live until he accomplished it.
But there he was, dead for want of a little food. Then
I stayed a long time alone&mdash;until I began to feel that I,
too, had something for the world. It began to burn in
my bones. I thought of him, dead and the world not
caring that he hadn't saved it&mdash;not even knowing it was
lost. But I kept thinking&mdash;a man can be so much more
than himself when he is alone&mdash;and it seemed to me
that I saw at least two things the world needed to know
&mdash;two things that would teach men to stop being
cowards and leaners.&quot;</p>

<p>Her sympathy was quick and ardent.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Bernal,&quot; she said warmly, &quot;you made me
believe when you believed nothing&mdash;and now, when I
need it above all other times, you make me believe
again! And you've come back with a message! How
glorious!&quot;</p>

<p>He smiled musingly.</p>

<p>&quot;I started with one, Nance&mdash;one that had grown in
me all those years till it filled my life and made me put
away everything. I didn't accept it at first. It found
me rebellious&mdash;wanting to live on the earth. Then
there came a need to justify myself&mdash;to show that I was
not the mere vicious unbeliever poor grandad thought
me. And so I fought to give myself up&mdash;and I won. I
found the peace of the lone places.&quot;</p>

<p>His voice grew dreamy&mdash;ceased, as if that peace were
indeed too utter for words. Then with an effort he
resumed:</p>

<p>&quot;But after a while the world began to rumble in my
ears. A man can't cut himself off from it forever. God
has well seen to that! As the message cleared in my
mind, there grew a need to give it out. This seemed
easy off there. The little puzzles that the world makes
so much of solved themselves for me. I saw them to be
puzzles of the world's own creating&mdash;all artificial&mdash;all
built up&mdash;fashioned clumsily enough from man's brute
fear of the half-God, half-devil he has always made in
his own image.</p>

<p>&quot;But now that I'm here, Nance, I find myself already
a little bewildered. The solution of the puzzles is as
simple as ever, but the puzzles themselves are more
complex as I come closer to them&mdash;so complex that my
simple answer will seem only a vague absurdity.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused and she felt his eyes upon her&mdash;felt that he
had turned from his abstractions to look at her more
personally.</p>

<p>&quot;Even since meeting you, Nance,&quot; he went on with
an odd, inward note in his voice, &quot;I've been wondering
if Hoover could by some chance have been right. When
I left, Hoover said I was a fool&mdash;a certain common
variety of fool.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm sure you're not&mdash;at least, not the common
kind. I dare say that a man must be a certain kind of
fool to think he can put the world forward by leaps and
bounds. I think he must be a fool to assume that the
world wants truth when it wants only to be assured that
it has already found the truth for itself. The man who
tells it what it already believes is never called a fool&mdash;
and perhaps he isn't. Indeed, I've come to think he is
less than a fool&mdash;that he's a mere polite echo. But oh,
Bernal, hold to your truth! Be the simple fool and
worry the wise in the cages they have built around
themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>She was leaning eagerly forward, forgetful of all save
that her starved need was feasting royally.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't give up; don't parrot the commoner fool's
conceits back to him for the sake of his solemn approval.
Let those of his kind give him what he wants, while
you meet those who must have more. I'm one of them,
Bernal. At this moment I honestly don't know whether
I'm a bad woman or a good one. And I'm frightened&mdash;
I'm so defenseless! Some little soulless circumstance
may make me decisively good or bad&mdash;and I don't
want to be bad! But give me what I want&mdash;I must
have that, regardless of what it makes me.&quot;</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, then at last spoke:</p>

<p>&quot;I used to think you were a rebel, Nance. Your
eyes betrayed it, and the corners of your mouth went up
the least little bit, as if they'd go further up before they
went down&mdash;as if you'd laugh away many solemn
respectabilities. But that's not bad. There are more
things to laugh at than are dreamed of. That's
Hoover's entire creed, by the way.&quot;</p>

<p>She remembered the name from that old tale of
Caleb Webster's.</p>

<p>&quot;Is&mdash;is this friend of yours&mdash;Mr. Hoover&mdash;in good
health?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine&mdash;weighs a hundred and eighty. He and I
have a ranch on the Wimmenuche&mdash;only Hoover's
been doing most of the work while I thought about
things. I see that. Hoover says one can't do much
for the world but laugh at it. He has a theory of his
own. He maintains that God set this planet whirling,
then turned away for a moment to start another universe
or something. He says that when the Creator
glances back at us again, to find this poor, scrubby little
earth-family divided over its clod, the strong robbing
the weak in the midst of plenty for all&mdash;enslaving them
to starve and toil and fight, spending more for war than
would keep the entire family in luxury; that when God
looks closer, in his amazement, and finds that, next to
greed, the matter of worshipping Him has made most of
the war and other deviltry&mdash;the hatred and persecution
and killing among all the little brothers&mdash;he will laugh
aloud before he reflects, and this little ballful of funny,
passionate insects will be blown to bits. He says if the
world comes to an end in his lifetime, he will know God
has happened to look this way, and perhaps overheard
a bishop say something vastly important about Apostolic
succession or the validity of the Anglican Orders
or Transubstantiation or 'communion in two kinds'
or something. He insists that a sense of humour is our
only salvation&mdash;that only those will be saved who happen
to be laughing for the same reason that God laughs
when He looks at us&mdash;that the little Mohammedans
and Christians and things will be burned for their
blasphemy of believing God not wise and good enough
to save them all, Mohammedan and Christian alike,
though not thinking excessively well of either; that only
those laughing at the whole gory nonsense will go into
everlasting life by reason of their superior faith in God.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course that's plausible, and yet it's radical.
Hoover's father was a bishop, and I think Hoover is just
a bit narrow from early training. He can't see that lots
of people who haven't a vestige of humour are nevertheless
worth saving. I admit that saving them will be a
thankless task. God won't be able to take very much
pleasure in it, but in strict justice he will do it&mdash;even
if Hoover does regard it as a piece of extravagant
sentimentality.&quot;</p>

<p>A little later she went in. She left him gazing far
off into the night, filled with his message, dull to memory
on the very scene that evoked in her own heart so
much from the old days. And as she went she laughed
inwardly at a certain consternation the woman of her
could not wholly put down; for she had blindly hurled
herself against a wall&mdash;the wall of his message. But it
was funny, and the message chained her interest. She
could, she thought, strengthen his resolution to give it
out&mdash;help him in a thousand ways.</p>

<p>As she fell asleep the thought of him hovered and
drifted on her heart softly, as darkness rests on tired
eyes.</p>

<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Remorse of Wondering Nancy</h3>

<p>She awoke to the sun, glad-hearted and made newly
buoyant by one of those soundless black sleeping-nights
that come only to the town-tired when they have
first fled. She ran to the glass to know if the restoration
she felt might also be seen. With unbiassed calculation
the black-fringed lids drew apart and one hand pushed
back of the temple, and held there, a tangled skein of
hair that had thrown the dusk of a deep wood about her
eyes. Then, as she looked, came the little dreaming
smile that unfitted critic eyes for their office; a smile
that wakened to a laugh as she looked&mdash;a little womanish
chuckle of confident joy, as one alone speaking
aloud in an overflowing moment.</p>

<p>An hour later she was greeting Bernal where the sun
washed through the big room.</p>

<p>&quot;Young life sings in me!&quot; she said, and felt his lightening
eyes upon her lips as she smiled.</p>

<p>There were three days of it&mdash;days in which, however,
she grew to fear those eyes, lest they fall upon her
in judgment. She now saw that his eyes had changed
most. They gave the face its look of absence, of dreaming
awkwardness. They had the depth of a hazy sky
at times, then cleared to a coldly lucid glance that would
see nothing ever to fear, within or without; that would
hide no falseness nor yet be deceived by any&mdash;a deadly
half-shut, appraising coolness that would know false
from true, even though they mated amicably and distractingly
in one mind.</p>

<p>The effect of this glance which she found upon herself
from time to time was to make Nancy suspect herself&mdash;
to question her motives and try her defenses. To
her amazement she found these latter weak under
Bernal's gaze, and there grew in her a tender remorse
for the injustice she had done her husband. From little
pricking suspicions on the first day she came on the
last to conviction. It seemed that being with Bernal
had opened her eyes to Allan's worth. She had narrowly,
flippantly misjudged a good man&mdash;good in all essentials.
She was contrite for her unwifely lack of abnegation.
She began to see herself and Allan with Bernal's eyes:
she was less than she had thought&mdash;he was more.
Bernal had proved these things to her all unconsciously.
Now her heart was flooded with gratitude for his simple,
ready, heartfelt praise of his brother&mdash;of his unfailing
good-temper, his loyalty, his gifts, his modesty so often
distressed by outspoken admiration of his personal
graces. She listened and applauded with a heart that
renewed itself in all good resolves of devotion. Even
when Bernal talked of himself, he made her feel that
she had been unjust to Allan.</p>

<p>Little by little she drew many things from him&mdash;the
story of his journeyings and of his still more intricate
mental wanderings. And it thrilled her to think he
had come back with a message&mdash;even though he already
doubted himself. Sometimes he would be jocular
about it and again hot with a passion to express himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Nance,&quot; he said on another night, &quot;when you have
a real faith in God a dead man is a miracle not less than
a living&mdash;and a live man dying is quite as wondrous as
a dead man living. Do you know, I was staggered one
day by discovering that the earth didn't give way when
I stepped on it? The primitive man knowing little of
physics doesn't know that a child's hand could move
the earth through space&mdash;but for a certain mysterious
resistance. That's God. I felt him all that day, at
every step, pushing the little globe back under me&mdash;
counteracting me&mdash;resisting me&mdash;ever so gently. Those
are times when you feel you must tell it, Nance&mdash;when
the God-consciousness comes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Bernal, if you could&mdash;if you could come back
to do what your grandfather really wanted you to do&mdash;
to preach something worth while!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt the need for my message, Nance. I need
for myself a God that could no more spare a Hottentot
than a Pope&mdash;but I doubt if the world does. No one
would listen to me&mdash;I'm only a dreamer. Once when
I was small they gave me a candy cane for Christmas.
It was a thing I had long worshipped in shop-windows
&mdash;actually worshipped as the primitive man worshipped
his idol. I can remember how sad I was when no one
else worshipped with me, or paid the least attention
to my treasure. I suspect I shall meet the same
indifference now. And I hope I'll have the same philosophy.
I remember I brought myself to eat the cane,
which I suppose is the primary intention regarding
them&mdash;and perhaps the fruits of one's faith should be
eaten quite as practically.&quot;</p>

<p>They had sent no word to Allan, agreeing it were better
fun to surprise him. When they took the train together
on the third day, the wife not less than the brother
looked forward to a joyous reunion with him. And
now that Nancy had proved in her heart the perverse
unwifeliness of her old attitude and was eager to begin
the symbolic rites of her atonement, it came to her to
wonder how Bernal would have judged her had she
persisted in that first wild impulse of rebellion. She
wanted to see from what degree of his reprobation she
had saved herself. She would be circuitous in her
approach.</p>

<p>&quot;You remember, Bernal, that night you went away
&mdash;how you said there was no moral law under the sky
for you but your own?&quot;</p>

<p>He smiled, and above the noise of the train his voice
came to her as his voice of old came above the noise of
the years.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;Nance&mdash;that was right. No moral law but
mine. I carried out my threat to make them all find
their authority in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you still believe yours is the only authority?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; it sounds licentious and horrible, doesn't it;
but there are two queer things about it&mdash;the first is that
man quite naturally <i>wishes</i> to be decent, and the second
is that, when he does come to rely wholly upon the
authority within himself, he finds it a stricter disciplinarian
than ever the decalogue was. One needs only
ordinary good taste to keep the ten commandments&mdash;
the moral ones. A man may observe them all and still
be morally rotten! But it's no joke to live by one's own
law, and yet that's all anybody has to keep him right,
if we only knew it, Nance&mdash;barring a few human statutes
against things like murder and keeping one's
barber-shop open on the Sabbath&mdash;the ruder offenses
which no gentleman ever wishes to commit.</p>

<p>&quot;And must poor woman be ruled by her own God,
too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's not so long ago that the fathers of the
Church were debating in council whether she had a
soul or not, charging her with bringing sin, sickness
and death into the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly. St. John Damascene called her 'a daughter
of falsehood and a sentinel of hell'; St. Jerome came
in with 'Woman is the gate of the devil, the road to
iniquity, the sting of the scorpion'; St. Gregory, I
believe, considered her to have no comprehension of
goodness; pious old Tertullian complimented her with
corrupting those whom Satan dare not attack; and then
there was St. Chrysostom&mdash;really he was much more
charitable than his fellow Saints&mdash;it always seemed to
me he was not only more humane but more human&mdash;
more interested, you might say. You know he said,
'Woman is a necessary evil, a domestic peril, a deadly
fascination, a painted ill.' It always seemed to me St.
Chrysostom had a past. But really, I think they all
went too far. I don't know woman very well, but I
suspect she has to find her moral authority where man
finds his&mdash;within herself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know what made me ask&mdash;a little woman in
town came to see Allan not long ago to know if she
mightn't leave her husband&mdash;she had what seemed to
her sufficient reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I imagine Allan said 'no.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He did. Would you have advised her differently?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bless you, no. I'd advise her to obey her priest.
The fact that she consulted him shows that she
has no law of her own. St. Paul said this wise
and deep thing: 'I know and am persuaded by the
Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself;
but to him that esteemeth anything unclean, to him it
is unclean!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it lay in her own view of it. If she had felt
free to go, she would have done right to go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet Allan talked to her about the sanctity of the
home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt if the sanctity of the home is maintained by
keeping unwilling mates together, Nance. I can
imagine nothing less sanctified than a home of that
sort&mdash;peopled by a couple held together against the
desire of either or both. The willing mates need no
compulsion, and they're the ones, it seems to me, that
have given the home its reputation for sanctity. I never
thought much about divorce, but I can see that much
at once. Of course, Allan takes the Church's attitude,
which survives from a time when a woman was
bought and owned; when the God of Moses classed
her with the ox and the ass as a thing one must not
covet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You really think if a woman has made a failure of
her marriage she has a right to break it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That seems sound as a general law, Nance&mdash;better
for her to make a hundred failures, for that matter,
than stay meekly in the first because of any superstition.
But, mind you, if she suspects that the Church may,
after all, have succeeded in tying up the infinite with
red-tape and sealing-wax&mdash;believes that God is a large,
dark notary-public who has recorded her marriage in a
book&mdash;she will do better to stay. Doubtless the conceit
of it will console her&mdash;that the God who looks after the
planets has an eye on her, to see that she makes but one
guess about so uncertain a thing as a man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you would advise&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I wouldn't. The woman who has to be advised
should never take advice. I dare say divorce is quite as
hazardous as marriage, though possibly most people
divorce with a somewhat riper discretion than they
marry with. But the point is that neither marriage nor
divorce can be considered a royal road to happiness, and
a woman ought to get her impetus in either case from
her own inner consciousness. I should call divorcing
by advice quite as silly as marrying by it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it comes at last to her own law in her own
heart?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When she has awakened to it&mdash;when she honestly
feels it. God's law for woman is the same as for man&mdash;
and he has but two laws for both that are universal and
unchanging: The first is, they are bound at all times
to desire happiness; the second is, that they can be
happy only by being wise&mdash;which is what we sometimes
mean when we say 'good,' but of course no one knows
what wisdom is for all, nor what goodness is for all,
because we are not mechanical dolls of the same pattern.
That's why I reverence God&mdash;the scheme is so
ingenious&mdash;so productive of variety in goodness and
wisdom. Probably an evil marriage is as hard to be
quit of as any vice. People persist long after the
sanctity has gone&mdash;because they lack moral courage.
Hoover was quite that way with cigarettes. If some
one could only have made Jim believe that God had
joined him to cigarettes, and that he mustn't quit them
or he'd shatter the foundations of our domestic integrity
&mdash;he'd have died in cheerful smoke&mdash;very soon after a
time when he says I saved his life. All he wanted was
some excuse to go on smoking. Most people are so&mdash;
slothful-souled. But remember, don't advise your
friend in town. Her asking advice is a sign that she
shouldn't have it. She is not of the coterie that Paul
describes&mdash;if you don't mind Paul once more&mdash;'Happy
is he that condemneth not himself in that which he
alloweth.'&quot;</p>

<p>There had come to the woman a vast influx of dignity
&mdash;a joyous increase in the volume of that new feeling
that called to her husband. She would have gone back,
but one of the reasons would have been because she
thought it &quot;right&quot;&mdash;because it was what the better
world did! But now&mdash;ah! now&mdash;she was going unhampered
by that compulsion which galls even the best.
She was free to stay away, but of her own glad, loyal
will she was going back to the husband she had treated
unjustly, judged by too narrow a standard.</p>

<p>&quot;Allan will be so astonished and delighted,&quot; she said,
when the coup&eacute; rolled out of the train-shed.</p>

<p>She remembered now with a sort of pride the fine,
unflinching sternness with which he had condemned
divorce. In a man of principles so staunch one might
overlook many surface eccentricities.</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Flexible Mind of a Pleased Husband</h3>

<p>As they entered the little reception-room from the
hall, the doors of the next room were pushed apart and
they saw Allan bowing out Mrs. Talwin Covil, a meek,
suppressed, neutral-tinted woman, the inevitable feminine
corollary of such a man as Cyrus Browett, whose
only sister she was.</p>

<p>The eyes of Nancy, glad with a knowing gladness,
were quick for Allan's face, resting fondly there during
the seconds in which he was changing from the dead
astonishment to live recognition at sight of Bernal.
During the shouts, the graspings, pokings, nudgings,
the pumping of each other's arms that followed, Nancy
turned to greet Mrs. Covil, who had paused before her.</p>

<p>&quot;Do sit down a moment and tell me things,&quot; she
urged, &quot;while those boys go back there to have it out!&quot;</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Mrs. Covil dropped into a chair,
seeming not loath to tell those things she had, while
Nancy leaned back and listened duteously for a perfunctory
ten minutes. Her thoughts ran ahead to
Allan&mdash;and to Bernal&mdash;as children will run little journeys
ahead of a slow-moving elder.</p>

<p>Then suddenly something that the troubled little
woman was saying fixed her attention, pulling up her
wandering thoughts with a jerk.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;and the Doctor asked me, my dear, to treat it
quite confidentially, except to bother Cyrus. But, I'm
sure he would wish you to know. Of course it is a
delicate matter&mdash;I can readily understand, as he
says, how the public would misconstrue the Doctor's
words and apply them generally&mdash;forgetting that each
case requires a different point of view. But with Harold
it is really a perfectly flagrant and dreadful case of
mismating&mdash;due entirely to the poor boy's thoughtless
chivalry&mdash;barely twenty-eight, mind you&mdash;as if a man
nowadays knows his mind at all well before thirty-five.
Of course, divorce is an evil that, broadly speaking,
threatens the sanctity of our home life&mdash;no one understands
that better than your husband&mdash;and re-marriage
after divorce is usually an outrageous scandal&mdash;one,
indeed, altogether too common&mdash;sometimes I wonder
what we're coming to, it seems to be done so thoughtlessly
&mdash;but individual instances are different&mdash;'exceptions
prove the rule,' you know, as the old saying goes.
Now Harold is ready to settle down, and the girl is of
excellent family and all that&mdash;quite the social and
moral brace he needs, in fact.&quot;</p>

<p>Nancy was attentive, yet a little puzzled.</p>

<p>&quot;But&mdash;you speak of your son, Harold&mdash;is he not
already married?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's it, my dear. You know what a funny,
bright, mischievous boy Harold is&mdash;even a little deliciously
wild at times&mdash;doubtless you read of his marriage
when it occurred&mdash;how these newspapers do relish
anything of the sort&mdash;she was a theatrical young woman
&mdash;what they call a 'show girl,' I believe. Humph!&mdash;
with reason, I <i>must</i> say! Of all the egregious and
inveterate showiness! My dear, she is positively a
creature! Oh, if they'd only invent a monocle that
would let a young man pierce the glamour of the footlights.
I pledge you my word, she's&mdash;but never mind
that! Harold was a thoughtless, restless boy&mdash;not bad,
you know, but heedless. Why, he was quite the same
about business. He began to speculate, and of course,
being brother Cyrus's nephew, his advantage was considerable.
But he suddenly declared he wouldn't be a
broker any more&mdash;and you'd never guess his absurd
reason: simply because some stock he held or didn't
hold went up or down or something on a rumour in the
street that Mr. Russell Sage was extremely ill! He
said that this brought him to his senses. He says to
me, 'Mater, I've not met Mr. Sage, you know, but from
what I hear of him it would be irrational to place myself
in a position where I should have to experience emotion
of any sort at news of the old gentleman's taking-off.
An event so agreeable to the natural order of God's
providence, so plausible, so seemly, should not be
endowed with any arbitrary and artificial significance,
especially of a monetary character&mdash;one must be able
to view it absolutely without emotion of any sort, either
of regret or rejoicing&mdash;one must remain conscientiously
indifferent as to when this excellent old gentleman
passes on to the Golden Shore'&mdash;&mdash;but you know the
breezy way in which Harold will sometimes talk. Only
now he seems really sobered by this new attachment&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if he is already married&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes&mdash;if you can call it married&mdash;a ceremony
performed by one of those common magistrates&mdash;quite
without the sanction of the Church&mdash;but all that is
past, and he is now ready to marry one who can be a
wife to him&mdash;only my conscience did hurt me a little,
and brother Cyrus said to me, 'You see Linford and tell
him I sent you. Linford is a man of remarkable breadth,
of rare flexibility.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and of course Allan was emphatically discouraging.
&quot; Again she was recalling the fervour with
which he had declared himself on this point on that last
day when he actually made her believe in him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the Doctor is broad! He is what I should call
adaptable. He said by all means to extricate Harold
from this wretched predicament, not only on account of
the property interests involved, but on account of his
moral and spiritual welfare; that, while in spirit he
holds deathlessly to the indissolubility of the marriage
tie, still it is unreasonable to suppose that God ever
joined Harold to a person so much his inferior, and
that we may look forward to the real marriage&mdash;that
on which the sanctity of the home is truly based&mdash;when
the law has freed him from this boyish entanglement.
Oh, my dear, I feel so relieved to know that my boy can
have a wife from his own class&mdash;and still have it right
up there&mdash;with Him, you know!&quot; she concluded with
an upward glance, as Nancy watched her with eyes
grown strangely quiet, almost steely&mdash;watched her as
one might watch an ant. She had the look of one whose
will had been made suddenly to stand aside by some
great inner tumult.</p>

<p>When her caller had gone she dropped back into the
chair, absently pulling a glove through the fingers of
one hand&mdash;her bag and parasol on the floor at her feet.
One might have thought her on the point of leaving
instead of having just come. The shadows were
deepening in the corners of the room and about her
half-shut eyes.</p>

<p>A long time she listened to the animated voices of the
brothers. At last the doors were pushed apart and they
came out, Allan with his hand on Bernal's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;There's your bag&mdash;now hurry upstairs&mdash;the maid
will show you where.&quot;</p>

<p>As Bernal went out, Nancy looked up at her husband
with a manner curiously quiet.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Nance&mdash;&quot; He stepped to the door to see
if Bernal was out of hearing&mdash;&quot;Bernal pleases me
in the way he talks about the old gentleman's estate.
Either he is most reasonable, or I have never known my
true power over men.&quot;</p>

<p>Her face was inscrutable. Indeed, she only half
heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Covil has been telling me some of your broader
views on divorce.&quot;</p>

<p>The words shot from her lips with the crispness of
an arrow, going straight to the bull's-eye. </p>

<p>He glanced quickly at her, the hint of a frown drawing
about his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Covil should have been more discreet. The
authority of a priest in these matters is a thing of delicate
adjustment&mdash;the law for one may not be the law
for all. These are not matters to gossip of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it seems. I was thinking of your opposite counsel
to Mrs. Eversley.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There&mdash;really, you know I read minds, at times&mdash;
somehow I knew that would be the next thing you'd
speak of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The circumstances are entirely different&mdash;I may
add that&mdash;that any intimation of inconsistency will be
very unpleasing to me&mdash;very!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can see that the circumstances are different&mdash;the
Eversleys are not what you would call 'important factors'
in the Church&mdash;and besides&mdash;that is a case of a
wife leaving her husband.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nance&mdash;I'm afraid you're <i>not</i> pleasing me&mdash;if I
catch your drift. Must I point out the difference&mdash;the
spiritual difference? That misguided woman wanted
to desert her husband merely because he had hurt her
pride&mdash;her vanity&mdash;by certain alleged attentions to
other women, concerning the measure of which I had
no knowledge. That was a case where the cross must
be borne for the true refining of that dross of vanity
from her soul. Her husband is of her class, and her
life with him will chasten her. While here&mdash;what have
we here?&quot;</p>

<p>He began to pace the floor as he was wont to do when
he prepared a sermon.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we have a flagrant example of what is nothing
less than spiritual miscegenation&mdash;that's it!&mdash;why didn't
I think of that phrase before&mdash;spiritual miscegenation.
A rattle-brained boy, with the connivance of a common
magistrate, effects a certain kind of alliance with a person
inferior to him in every point of view&mdash;birth, breeding,
station, culture, wealth&mdash;a person, moreover, who
will doubtless be glad to relinquish her so-called rights
for a sum of money. Can that, I ask you, be called a
<i>marriage?</i> Can we suppose an all-wise God to have
joined two natures so ill-adapted, so mutually exclusive,
so repellent to each other after that first glamour is past.
Really, such a supposition is not only puerile but irreverent.
It is the conventional supposition, I grant, and
theoretically, the unvarying supposition of the Church;
but God has given us reasoning powers to use fearlessly
&mdash;not to be kept superstitiously in the shackles of
any tradition whatsoever. Why, the very Church
itself from its founding is an example of the wisdom of
violating tradition when it shall seem meet&mdash;it has
always had to do this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, Allan&mdash;every case must be judged by itself;
every marriage requires a special ruling&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;er&mdash;exactly&mdash;only don't get to fancying that
you could solve these problems. It's difficult enough
for a priest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm positive a mere woman couldn't grapple
with them&mdash;she hasn't the mind to! All she is capable
of is to choose who shall think for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And of course it would hardly do to announce that
I had counselled a certain procedure of divorce and
re-marriage&mdash;no matter how flagrant the abuse, nor
how obvious the spiritual equity of the step. People at
large are so little analytical.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Flexible,' Mr. Browett told his sister you were.
He was right&mdash;you <i>are</i> flexible, Allan&mdash;more so than I
ever suspected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nance&mdash;you <i>please</i> me&mdash;you are a good girl. Now
I'm going up to Bernal. Bernal certainly pleases me.
Of course I shall do the handsome thing by him if he
acts along the lines our talk has indicated.&quot;</p>

<p>She still sat in the falling dusk, in the chair she had
taken two hours before, when Aunt Bell came in,
dressed for dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy, child! Do you know how late it is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you say, Aunt Bell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say do you know how late it is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&mdash;not too late!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not too late&mdash;for what?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause, then she said: &quot;Aunt Bell, when
a woman comes to make her very last effort at self-deception,
why does she fling herself into it with such
abandon&mdash;such pretentious flourishes of remorse&mdash;
and things? Is it because some under layer of her soul
knows it will be the last and will have it a thorough
test? I wonder how much of an arrant fraud a woman
may really be to herself, even in her surest, happiest
moments.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There you are again, wondering, wondering&mdash;
instead of accepting things and dressing for dinner.
Have you seen Allan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes&mdash;I've been seeing him for three days&mdash;
through a glass, darkly.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell flounced on into the library, trailing something
perilously near a sniff.</p>

<p>Bernal came down the stairs and stood in the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Nance!&quot; He went to stand before her and
she looked up to him. There was still light enough to
see his eyes&mdash;enough to see, also, that he was embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;I've had quite a talk with Allan.&quot; He
laughed a little constrained, uneasy laugh, looking
quickly at her to see if she might be observing him.
&quot;He's the same fine old chap, isn't he?&quot; Quickly his
eyes again sought her face. &quot;Yes, indeed, he's the
same old boy&mdash;a great old Allan&mdash;only he makes me
feel that I have changed, Nance.&quot;</p>

<p>She arose from her chair, feeling cramped and restless
from sitting so long.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure you haven't changed, Bernal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I must have!&quot;</p>

<p>He was looking at her very closely through the dusk.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we had an interesting talk,&quot; he said again.</p>

<p>He reached out to take one of her hands, which he
held an instant in both his own. &quot;He's a rare old
Allan, Nance!&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Wheels within Wheels of the Great Machine</h3>

<p>For three days the brothers were inseparable. There
were so many ancient matters to bring forward of which
each could remember but a half; so many new ones, of
which each must tell his own story. And there was a
matter of finance between them that had been brought
forward by Allan without any foolish delay. Each of
them spoke to Nancy about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal has pleased me greatly,&quot; said her husband.
&quot;He agrees that Grandfather Delcher could not have
been himself when he made that will&mdash;being made as it
was directly after he sent Bernal off. He finds it
absurd that the old man, so firm a Christian, should
have disinherited a Christian, one devoted to the ministry
of Jesus, for an unbeliever like Bernal. It is true, I
talked to him in this strain myself, and I cannot deny
that I wield even a greater influence over men than
over women. I dare say I could have brought Bernal
around even had he been selfish and stubborn. By
putting a proposition forward as a matter of course,
one may often induce another to accept it as such,
whereas he might dispute it if it were put forward as at
all debatable. But as a matter of fact he required no
talking to; he accepted my views readily. The boy
doesn't seem to know the value of money. I really believe
he may decide to make over the whole of the property
to me. That is what I call a beautiful unselfishness.
But I shall do handsomely by him&mdash;probably he can
use some money in that cattle business. I had thought
first of ten thousand dollars, but doubtless half that
will be wiser. I shall insist upon his taking at least
half that. He will find that unselfishness is a game
two can play at.&quot;</p>

<p>Nancy had listened to this absently, without comment.
Nor had Bernal moved her to speech when he
said, &quot;You know, Allan is such a sensitive old chap&mdash;
you wouldn't guess how sensitive. His feelings were
actually hurt because I'd kept him out of grandad's
money all these years. He'd forgotten that I didn't
know I was doing it. Of course the old boy was thinking
what he'd have done in my place&mdash;but I think I can
make it right with him&mdash;I'm sure now he knows I
didn't mean to wrong him.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet during this speech he had shot furtive little questioning
looks at her face, as if to read those thoughts he
knew she would not put into words.</p>

<p>But she only smiled at Bernal. Her husband, however,
found her more difficult than ever after communicating
his news to her. He tried once to imagine
her being dissatisfied with him for some reason. But
this attempt he abandoned. Thereafter he attributed
her coldness, aloofness, silence, and moodiness to some
nervous malady peculiar to the modern woman. Bernal's
presence kept him from noting how really pronounced
and unwavering her aversion had become.</p>

<p>Nor did Bernal note her attitude. Whatever he may
have read in Allan at those times when the look of cold
appraisement was turned full upon him, he had come
to know of his brother's wife only that she was Nancy of
the old days, strangely surviving to greet him and be
silent with him, or to wonder with him when he came
in out of that preposterous machine of many wheels that
they called the town. No one but Nancy saw anything
about it to wonder at.</p>

<p>To Bernal, after his years in the big empty places, it
was a part of all the world and of all times compacted
in a small space. One might see in it ancient Jerusalem,
Syria, Persia, Rome and modern Babylon&mdash;with something
still peculiar and unclassifiable that one would
at length have to call New York. And to make it more
absorbing, the figures were always moving. Where so
many were pressed together each was weighted by a
thousand others&mdash;the rich not less than the poor; each
was stirred to quick life and each was being visibly worn
down by the ceaseless friction.</p>

<p>When he had walked the streets for a week, he saw the
city as a huge machine, a machine to which one might
not even deliver a message without becoming a part of
it&mdash;a wheel of it. It was a machine always readjusting,
always perfecting, always repairing itself&mdash;casting out
worn or weak parts and taking in others&mdash;ever replacing
old wheels with new ones, and never disdaining any new
wheel that found its place&mdash;that could give its cogs to
the general efficiency, consenting to be worn down by
the unceasing friction.</p>

<p>Looking down Broadway early one evening&mdash;a shining
avenue of joy&mdash;he thought of the times when he
had gazed across a certain valley of his West and
dreamed of bringing a message to this spot.</p>

<p>Against the sky many electric signs flamed garishly.
Beneath them were the little grinding wheels of the
machine&mdash;satisfied, joyous, wisely sufficient unto themselves,
needing no message&mdash;least of all the simple old
truth he had to give. He tried to picture his message
blazing against the sky among the other legends: from
where he stood the three most salient were the names of
a popular pugilist, a malt beverage and a theatre. The
need of another message was not apparent.</p>

<p>So he laughed at himself and went down into the
crowd foregathered in ways of pleasure, and there he
drank of the beer whose name was flaunted to the simple
stars. Truly a message to this people must be put
into a sign of electric bulbs; into a phonograph to be
listened to for a coin, with an automatic banjo accompaniment;
or it must be put upon the stage to be acted
or sung or danced! Otherwise he would be a wheel
rejected&mdash;a wheel ground up in striving to become a
part of the machine at a place where no wheel was
needed.</p>

<p>For another experience cooling to his once warm
hopes, the second day of his visit Allan had taken him
to his weekly Ministers' Meeting&mdash;an affair less formidable
than its title might imply.</p>

<p>A dozen or so good fellows of the cloth had luncheon
together each Tuesday at the house of one or another,
or at a restaurant; and here they talked shop or not as
they chose, the thing insisted upon being congeniality
&mdash;that for once in the week they should be secure from
bores.</p>

<p>Here Presbyterian and Unitarian met on common
ground; Baptist, Catholic, Episcopalian, Congregationalist,
Methodist&mdash;all became brothers over the
soup. Weekly they found what was common and helpful
to all in discussing details of church administration,
matters of faith, methods of handling their charitable
funds; or the latest heresy trial. They talked of these
things amiably, often lightly. They were choice
spirits relaxed, who might be grave or gay, as they
listed.</p>

<p>Their vein was not too serious the day Bernal was his
brother's guest, sitting between the very delightful
Father Riley and the exciting Unitarian, one Whittaker.
With tensest interest he listened to their talk.</p>

<p>At first there was a little of Delitzsch and his Babel-Bible
addresses, brought up by Selmour, an amiable
Presbyterian of shining bare pate and cheerful red
beard, a man whom scandal had filliped ever so coyly
with a repute of leanings toward Universalism.</p>

<p>This led to a brief discussion of the old and new
theology&mdash;Princeton standing for the old with its
definition of Christianity as &quot;a piece of information
given supernaturally and miraculously&quot;; Andover
standing for the new&mdash;so alleged Whittaker&mdash;with
many polite and ingenious evasions of this proposition
without actually repudiating it.</p>

<p>The Unitarian, however, was held to be the least bit
too literal in his treatment of propositions not his own.</p>

<p>Then came Pleydell, another high-church Episcopalian
who, over his chop and a modest glass of claret,
declared earnest war upon the whole Hegel-Darwinian-Wellhausen
school. His method of attack was to state
baldly the destructive conclusions of that school&mdash;that
most of the books of the Old Testament are literary
frauds, intentionally misrepresenting the development
of religion in Israel; that the whole Mosaic code is a
later fabrication and its claim to have been given in the
wilderness an historical falsehood. From this he
deduced that a mere glance at the Bible, as the higher
critics explain it, must convince the earnest Christian
that he can have no share in their views. &quot;Deprive
Christianity of its supernatural basis,&quot; he said, &quot;and
you would have a mere speculative philosophy. Deny
the Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden, and the Atonement
becomes meaningless. If we have not incurred
God's wrath through Adam's disobedience, we need
no Saviour. That is the way to meet the higher criticism,
&quot; he concluded earnestly.</p>

<p>As the only rule of the association was that no man
should talk long upon any matter, Floud, the fiery and
aggressive little Baptist, hereupon savagely reviewed a
late treatise on the ethnic Trinities, put out by a professor
of ecclesiastical history in a New England theological
seminary. Floud marvelled that this author
could retain his orthodox standing, for he viewed the
Bible as a purely human collection of imperfect writings,
the wonder-stories concerning the birth and death of
Jesus as deserving no credence, and denied to Christianity
any supernatural foundation. Polytheism was
shown to be the soil from which all trinitarian conceptions
naturally spring&mdash;the Brahmanic, Zoroastrian,
Homeric, Plotinian, as well as the Christian trinity&mdash;
the latter being a Greek idea engrafted on a Jewish
stalk. The author's conclusion, by which he reached
&quot;an undogmatic gospel of the spirit, independent of all
creeds and forms&mdash;a gospel of love to God and man,
with another Trinity of Love, Truth and Freedom,&quot;
was particularly irritating to the disturbed Baptist,
who spoke bitterly of the day having dawned when
the Church's most dangerous enemies were those
critical vipers whom she had warmed in her own
bosom.</p>

<p>Suffield, the gaunt, dark, but twinkling-eyed Methodist,
also sniffed at the conclusion of the ethnic-trinities
person. &quot;We have an age of substitutes,&quot; he remarked.
&quot;We have had substitutes for silk and sealskin&mdash;very
creditable substitutes, so I have been assured by a lady
in whom I have every confidence&mdash;substitutes for coffee,
for diamonds&mdash;substitutes for breakfast which are
widely advertised&mdash;substitutes for medicine&mdash;and now
we are coming to have substitutes for religion&mdash;even
a substitute for hell!&quot;</p>

<p>Hereupon he told of a book he had read, also written
by an orthodox professor of theology, in which the argument,
advanced upon scriptural evidence, was that the
wicked do not go into endless torment, but ultimately
shrivel and sink into a state of practical unconsciousness.
Yet the author had been unable to find any foundation
for universalism. This writer, Suffield explained,
holds that the curtain falls after the judgment on a lost
world. Nor is there probation for the soul after the
body dies. The Scriptures teach the ruin of the final
rejecters of Christ; Christ teaches plainly that they who
reject the Gospel will perish in the endless darkness of
night. But eternal punishment does not necessarily
mean eternal suffering; hence the hypothesis of the soul
gradually shrivelling for the sin of its unbelief.</p>

<p>The amiable Presbyterian sniffed at this as a sentimental
quibble. Punishment ceases to be punishment
when it is not felt&mdash;one cannot punish a tree or an
unconscious soul. But this was the spirit of the age.
With the fires out in hell, no wonder we have an age of
sugar-candy morality and cheap sentimentalism.</p>

<p>But here the Unitarian wickedly interrupted, to
remind his Presbyterian brother that his own church
had quenched those very certain fires that once burned
under the pit in which lay the souls of infants unbaptised.</p>

<p>The amiable Presbyterian, not relishing this, still
amiably threw the gauntlet down to Father Riley, demanding
the Catholic view of the future of unbaptised
children.</p>

<p>The speech of the latter was a mellow joy&mdash;a south
breeze of liquid consonants and lilting vowels finely
articulated. Perhaps it was not a little owing to the
good man's love for what he called &quot;oiling the rusty
hinges of the King's English with a wee drop of the
brogue&quot;; but, if so, the oil was so deftly spread that no
one word betrayed its presence. Rather was his whole
speech pervaded by this soft delight, especially when
his cherubic face, his pink cheeks glistening in certain
lights with a faint silvery stubble of beard, mellowed with
his gentle smile. It was so now, even when he spoke of
God's penalties for the souls of reprobate infants.</p>

<p>&quot;All theologians of the Mother Church are agreed,&quot;
replied the gracious father, &quot;first, that infants dying
unbaptised are excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven.
Second, that they will not enjoy the beatific vision outside
of heaven. Third, that they will arise with adults
and be assembled for judgment on the last day. And,
fourth, that after the last day there will be but two
states, namely: a state of supernatural and supreme
felicity and a state of what, in a wide sense, we may
call damnation.&quot;</p>

<p>Purlingly the good man went on to explain that
damnation is a state admitting of many degrees; and
that the unbaptised infant would not suffer in that state
the same punishment as the adult reprobate. While
the latter would suffer positive pains of mind and body
for his sins, the unfortunate infant would doubtless
suffer no pain of sense whatever. As to their being
exempt from the pain of loss, grieving over their exclusion
from the sight of God and the glories of His Kingdom,
it is more commonly held that they do not suffer
even this; that even if they know others are happier than
themselves, they are perfectly resigned to God's will and
suffer no pain of loss in regard to happiness not suited
to their condition.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian called upon them to witness that his
church was thus not unique in attaining this sentimentality
regarding reprobate infants.</p>

<p>Then little Floud cited the case of still another heretic
within the church, a professor in a western Methodist
university, who declared that biblical infallibility is a
superstitious and hurtful tradition; that all the miracles
are mere poetic fancies, incredible and untrue&mdash;even
irreverent; and that all spiritual truth comes to man
through his brain and conscience. Modern preaching,
according to the book of this heretic, lacks power
because so many churches cling to the tradition that
the Bible is infallible. It is the golden calf of their
worship; the palpable lie that gives the ring of insincerity
to all their moral exhortations.</p>

<p>So the talk flowed on until the good men agreed that a
peculiarity of the time lay in this: that large numbers
of ministers within the church were publishing the
most revolutionary heresies while still clinging to some
shred of their tattered orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Also they decided that it would not be without interest
to know what belief is held by the man of common
education and intelligence&mdash;the man who behaves correctly
but will not go to church.</p>

<p>Here Father Riley sweetly reminded them&mdash;&quot;No
questions are asked in the Mother Church, gentlemen,
that may not be answered with authority. In your
churches, without an authority superior to mere reason,
destructive questions will be asked more and more
frequently.&quot;</p>

<p>Gravely they agreed that the church was losing its
hold on the people. That but for its social and charitable
activities, its state would be alarming.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Your</i> churches!&quot; Father Riley corrected with suave
persistence. &quot;No church can endure without an infallible
head.&quot;</p>

<p>Again and again during the meal Bernal had been
tempted to speak. But each time he had been
restrained by a sense of his aloofness. These men,
too, were wheels within the machine, each revolving as
he must. They would simply pity him, or be amused.</p>

<p>More and more acutely was he coming to feel the
futility, the crass, absurd presumption of what he had
come back to undertake. From the lucid quiet of his
mountain haunts he had descended into a vale where
antiquated cymbals clashed in wild discordance above
the confusing clatter of an intricate machinery&mdash;machinery
too complicated to be readjusted by a passing
dreamer. In his years of solitude he had grown to
believe that the teachers of the world were no longer
dominated by that ancient superstition of a superhumanly
malignant God. He had been prepared to
find that the world-ideal had grown more lofty in his
absence, been purified by many eliminations into a
God who, as he had once said to Nance, could no more
spare the soul of a Hottentot than the soul of a pope.
Yet here was a high type of the priest of the Mother
Church, gentle, Godly, learned, who gravely and as
one having authority told how God would blight forever
the soul of a child unbaptised, thus imputing to
Deity a regard for mechanical rites that would constitute
even a poor human father an incredible monster.</p>

<p>Yet the marvel of it seemed to him to lie in this: that
the priest himself lived actually a life of loving devotion
and sacrifice in marked opposition to this doctrine of
formal cruelty; that his church, more successfully than
any other in Christendom, had met the needs of humanity,
coming closer to men in their sin and sickness, ministering
to them with a deeper knowledge, a more affectionate
intimacy, than any other. That all these men of
God should hold formally to dogmas belying the humaneness
of their actual practise&mdash;here was the puzzling
anomaly that might well give pause to any casual
message-bringer. Struggle as he might, it was like a
tangling mesh cast over him&mdash;this growing sense of
his own futility.</p>

<p>Along with this conviction of his powerlessness there
came to him a new sense of reliance upon Nancy.
Unconsciously at first he turned to her for sunlight,
big views and quiet power, for the very stimulus he had
been wont to draw from the wide, high reaches of his
far-off valley. Later, came a conscious turning, an
open-eyed bringing of all his needs, to lay them in her
waiting lap. Then it was he saw that on that first night
at Edom her confidence and enthusiasm had been
things he leaned upon quite naturally, though unwittingly.
The knowledge brought him a vague unrest.
Furtive, elusive impulses, borne to him on the wings
of certain old memories&mdash;memories once resolutely
put away in the face of his one, big world-desire&mdash;now
came to trouble him.</p>

<p>It seemed that one must forever go in circles. With
fine courage he had made straight off to toil up the high
difficult paths of the ideal. Never had he consciously
turned, nor even swerved. Yet here he was at length
upon his old tracks, come again to the wondering girl.</p>

<p>Did it mean, then, that his soul was baffled&mdash;or did
it mean that his soul would not suffer him to baffle it,
try as he might? Was that girl of the old days to greet
him with her wondering eyes at the end of every high
path? These and many other questions he asked
himself.</p>

<p>At the close of this day he sought her, eager for the
light of her understanding eyes&mdash;for a certain waiting
sympathy she never withheld. As she looked up now
with a kind of composed gladness, it seemed to him
that they two alone, out of all the world, were sanely
quiet. Silently he sank into a chair near her and they
sat long thus, feeling no need of words. At last she
spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you coming nearer to it, Bernal?&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm farther away than ever, Nance. Probably
there's but one creature in this city to-day as out of
place as I am. He's a big, awkward, country-looking
dog, and he was lost on Broadway. Did you ever see
a lost dog in a city street? This fellow was actually
in a panic, wholly demoralised, and yet he seemed to
know that he must conceal it for his own safety. So
he affected a fine air of confidence, of being very busy
about an engagement for which he feared he might be
late. He would trot swiftly along for half a block,
then pause as if trying to recall the street number;
then trot a little farther, and stop to look back as if
the other party to his engagement might happen along
from that direction. It was a splendid bit of acting,
and it deceived them all, in that street of mutterers
and hard faces. He was like one of them, busy and
hurried, but apparently cool, capable, and ominously
alert. Only, in his moments of indecision, his eyes
shifted the least bit nervously, as if to note whether
the real fear he felt were detected, and then I could
read all his secret consternation.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm the same lost dog, Nance. I feel as he felt
every time I go into that street where the poor creatures
hurry and talk to themselves from sheer nervous
fatigue.&quot;</p>

<p>He ceased speaking, but she remained silent, fearing
lest she say too little or too much.</p>

<p>&quot;Nance,&quot; he said presently with a slow, whimsical
glance, &quot;I'm beginning to suspect that I'm even more
of a fool than Hoover thought me&mdash;and he was rather
enthusiastic about it, I assure you!&quot;</p>

<p>To which she at length answered musingly:</p>

<p>&quot;If God makes us fools, doubtless he likes to have
us thorough. Be a great fool, Bernal. Don't be a
small one.&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Ineffective Message</h3>

<p>The week had gone while he walked in the crowds,
feeling his remoteness; but he knew at last that he was
not of the brotherhood of the zealots; that the very
sense of humour by which he saw the fallacies of one
zealot prevented him from becoming another. He
lacked the zealot's conviction of his unique importance,
yet one must be such a zealot to give a message effectively.
He began to see that the world could not be
lost; that whatever might be vital in his own message
would, soon or late, be delivered by another. The
time mattered not. Could he not be as reposeful, as
patient, as God?</p>

<p>In spite of which, the impulse to speak his little word
would recur; and it came upon him stoutly one day
on his way up town. As the elevated train slowly
rounded a curve he looked into the open window of
a room where a gloomy huddle of yellow-faced, sunken-cheeked,
brown-bearded men bent their heads over
busy sewing-machines. Nearest the window, full
before it, was one that touched him&mdash;a young man
with some hardy spirit of hope still enduring in his
starved face, some stubborn refusal to recognise the
odds against him. And fixed to his machine, where
his eyes might now and then raise to it from his work,
was a spray of lilac&mdash;his little spirit flaunting itself
gaily even from the cross. The pathos of it was
somehow intensified by the grinding of the wheels
that carried him by it.</p>

<p>The train creaked its way around the curve&mdash;but
the face dreaming happily over the lilac spray in that
hopeless room stayed in his mind, coercing him.</p>

<p>As he entered the house, Nancy met him.</p>

<p>&quot;Do go and be host to those men. It's our day for
the Ministers' Meeting,&quot; she continued, as he looked
puzzled, &quot;and just as they sat down Allan was called
out to one of his people who is sick. Now run like
a good boy and 'tend to them.&quot;</p>

<p>So it came that, while the impulse was still strong
upon him, he went in among the dozen amiable, feeding
gentlemen who were not indisposed to listen to whomsoever
might talk&mdash;if he did not bore&mdash;which is how
it befell that they had presently cause to remark him.</p>

<p>Not at first, for he mumbled hesitatingly, without
authority of manner or point to his words, but the
phrase, &quot;the fundamental defect of the Christian
religion&quot; caused even the Unitarian to gasp over his
glass of mineral water. His green eyes glittered pleasantly
upon Bernal from his dark face with its scraggly
beard.</p>

<p>&quot;That's it, Mr. Linford&mdash;tell us that&mdash;we need to
know that&mdash;do we not, gentlemen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speak for yourself, Whittaker,&quot; snapped the aggressive
little Baptist, &quot;but doubtless Mr. Linford has
something to say.&quot;</p>

<p>Bernal remained unperturbed by this. Very earnestly
he continued: &quot;Christianity is defective, judged
even by poor human standards; untrue by the plain
facts of human consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Now we shall learn!&quot; Father Riley turned
his most gracious smile upon the speaker.</p>

<p>&quot;Your churches are losing their hold upon men
because your religion is one of separation, here and
hereafter&mdash;while the one great tendency of the age is
toward brotherhood&mdash;oneness. Primitive man had
individual pride&mdash;family pride, city pride, state pride,
national pride followed&mdash;but we are coming now to
the only permissible pride, a world pride&mdash;in which
the race feels its oneness. We are nearly there; even
now the spirit that denies this actual brotherhood is
confined to the churches. The people outside more
generally than you dream know that God does not discriminate
among religions&mdash;that he has a scheme of
a dignity so true that it can no more permit the loss of
one black devil-worshipper than that of the most magnificent
of archbishops.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped, looking inquiringly&mdash;almost wistfully,
at them.</p>

<p>Various polite exclamations assured him of their
interest.</p>

<p>&quot;Continue, by all means,&quot; urged Whittaker. &quot;I
feel that you will have even Father Riley edified in a
moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The most cynical chap&mdash;even for a Unitarian,&quot;
purled that good man.</p>

<p>Bernal resumed.</p>

<p>&quot;Your God is a tribal God who performed his wonders
to show that he had set a difference between Israel
and Egypt. Your Saviour continues to set the same
difference: Israel being those who believed his claim
to Godship; Egypt those who find his evidence insufficient.
But we humans daily practise better than
this preaching of retaliation. The Church is losing
power because your creeds are fixed while man, never
ceasing to grow, has inevitably gone beyond them&mdash;
even beyond the teachings of your Saviour who threatened
to separate father from son and mother from
daughter&mdash;who would distinguish sheep from goats
by the mere intellectual test of the opinion they formed
of his miracles. The world to-day insists on moral
tests&mdash;which Christianity has never done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah&mdash;now we are getting at it,&quot; remarked the
Methodist, whose twinkling eyes curiously belied his
grimly solemn face. &quot;Who was it that wished to
know the belief of the average unbeliever?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The average unbeliever,&quot; answered Bernal promptly,
&quot;no longer feels the need of a Saviour&mdash;he knows
that he must save himself. He no longer believes
in the God who failed always, from Eden to Calvary,
failed even to save his chosen tribe by that last
device of begetting a son of a human mother who
should be sacrificed to him. He no longer believes
that he must have a mediator between himself and
that God.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, most refreshing,&quot; chortled Father Riley.
&quot;More, more!&quot; and he rapped for silence.</p>

<p>&quot;The man of to-day must have a God who never
fails. Disguise it as you will, your Christian God was
never loved. No God can be loved who threatens
destruction for not loving him. We cannot love one
whom we are not free <i>not</i> to love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where shall we find this God&mdash;outside of Holy
Writ,&quot; demanded Floud, who had once or twice restrained
himself with difficulty, in spite of his amusement.</p>

<p>&quot;The true God comes to life in your own consciousness,
if you will clear it of the blasphemous preconceptions
imposed by Christianity,&quot; answered Bernal so
seriously that no one had the heart to interrupt him.
&quot;Of course we can never personify God save as a higher
power of self. Moses did no more; Jesus did no more.
And if we could stop with this&mdash;be content with saying
'God is better than the best man'&mdash;we should have a
formula permitting endless growth, even as He permits
it to us. God has been more generous to us than the
Church has been to Him. While it has limited Him to
that god of bloody sacrifice conceived by a barbaric
Jew, He has permitted us to grow so that now any man
who did not surpass him morally, as the scriptures portray
him, would be a man of inconceivable malignity.</p>

<p>&quot;You see the world has demonstrated facts that disprove
the Godship of your God and your Saviour. We
have come, indeed, into a sense of such certain brotherhood
that we know your hell is a falsity. We know
&mdash;a knowledge of even the rudiments of psychology
proves&mdash;<i>that there will be a hell for all as long as one of
us is there</i>. Our human nature is such that one soul
in hell would put every other soul there. Daily this
becomes more apparent. We grow constantly more
sensitive to the pain of others. This is the distinctive
feature of modern growth&mdash;our increasing tendency to
find the sufferings of others intolerable to ourselves.
A disaster now is felt around the world&mdash;we burn or
starve or freeze or drown with our remote brothers&mdash;
and we do what we can to relieve them because we
suffer with them. It seems to me the existence of the
S.P.C.A. proves that hell is either for all of us or for
none of us&mdash;because of our oneness. If the suffering
of a stray cat becomes our suffering, do you imagine
that the minority of the race which Christianity saves
could be happy knowing that the great majority lay in
torment?</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose but two were left in hell&mdash;Judas Iscariot
and Herbert Spencer&mdash;the first great sinner after Jesus
and the last of any consequence. One betrayed his
master and the other did likewise, only with far greater
subtlety and wickedness&mdash;teaching thousands to disbelieve
his claims to godhood&mdash;to regard Christianity
as a crude compound of Greek mythology and Jewish
tradition&mdash;a thing built of myth and fable. Even if
these two were damned and all the rest were saved&mdash;
can you not see that a knowledge of their suffering
would embitter heaven itself to another hell? Father
Riley was good enough to tell us last week of the state of
unbaptised infants after death. Will you please consider
coldly the infinite, good God setting a difference
for all eternity between two babies, because over the
hairless pate of one a priest had sprinkled water and
spoken words? Can you not see that this is untrue
because it is absurd to our God-given senses of humour
and justice? Do you not see that such a God, in the
act of separating those children, taking into heaven the
one that had had its little head wetted by a good man,
and sending the reprobate into what Father Riley terms,
'in a wide sense, a state of damnation'&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Father Riley smiled upon him with winning sweetness.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;do you not see that such a God would be shamed
off his throne and out of heaven by the pitying laugh
that would go up&mdash;even from sinners?</p>

<p>&quot;You insist that the truth touching faith and morals
is in your Bible, despite its historical inaccuracies. But
do you not see that you are losing influence with the
world because this is not so&mdash;because a higher standard
of ethics than yours prevails out in the world&mdash;a demand
for a veritable fatherhood of God and a veritable
brotherhood of man&mdash;to replace the caricatures of
those doctrines that Christianity submits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our young friend seems to think exceeding well of
human nature,&quot; chirped Father Riley.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; rejoined Bernal. &quot;Isn't it droll that this
poor, fallen human nature, despised and reviled, 'conceived
in sin and born in iniquity,' should at last call
the Christian God and Saviour to account, weigh them
by its own standard, find them wanting, and replace
them with a greater God born of itself? Is not that an
eloquent proof of the living God that abides in us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has it ever occurred to you, young man, that human
nature has its selfish moments?&quot; asked the high-church
rector&mdash;between sips of claret and water.</p>

<p>&quot;Has it ever occurred to you that human nature has
<i>any</i> but selfish moments?&quot; replied Bernal. &quot;If so,
your impression was incorrect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, Mr. Linford, have you not just been telling
us how glorious is this nature of man&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know&mdash;I will explain to you,&quot; he went on, moving
Father Riley to another indulgent smile by his willingness
to instruct the gray-bearded Congregationalist
who had interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;When I saw that there must be a hell for all so long
as there is a hell for one&mdash;even for Spencer&mdash;I suddenly
saw there was nothing in any man to merit the place&mdash;
unless it were the ignorance of immaturity. For I saw
that man by the very first law of his being can never have
any but a selfish motive. Here again practical psychology
sustains me. You cannot so much as raise your
hand without an intention to promote your happiness&mdash;
nor are you less selfish if you give your all to the needy
&mdash;you are still equally doing that which promotes your
happiness. That it is more blessed to give than to
receive is a terse statement of a law scientifically demonstrable.
You all know how far more exquisite is the
pleasure that comes from giving than that which comes
from receiving. Is not one who prefers to give then
simply selfish with a greater wisdom, a finer skill for the
result desired&mdash;his own pleasure? The man we call
good is not less selfish than the man we call bad&mdash;only
wiser in the ways that bring his happiness&mdash;riper in
that divine sensitiveness to the feelings of his brother.
Selfish happiness is equally a law with all, though it
send one of us to thieving and another to the cross.</p>

<p>&quot;Ignorance of this primary truth has kept the world
in spiritual darkness&mdash;it has nurtured belief in sin&mdash;in
a devil, in a God that permits evil. For when you tell
me that my assertion is a mere quibble&mdash;that it matters
not whether we call a man unselfish or wisely selfish&mdash;
you fail to see that, when we understand this truth, there
is no longer any sin. 'Sin' is then seen to be but a mistaken
notion of what brings happiness. Last night's
burglar and your bishop differ not morally but intellectually
&mdash;one knowing surer ways of achieving his
own happiness, being more sensitive to that oneness of
the race which thrills us all in varying degrees. When
you know this&mdash;that the difference is not moral but
intellectual, self-righteousness disappears and with it a
belief in moral difference&mdash;the last obstacle to the
realisation of our oneness. It is in the church that this
fiction of moral difference has taken its final stand.</p>

<p>&quot;And not only shall we have no full realisation of the
brotherhood of man until this inevitable, equal selfishness
is understood, but we shall have no rational conception
of virtue. There will be no sound morality
until it is taught for its present advantage to the individual,
and not for what it may bring him in a future
world. Not until then will it be taught effectively that
the well-being of one is inextricably bound up with the
 well-being of all; that while man is always selfish, his
 selfish happiness is still contingent on the happiness of
 his brother.&quot;</p>

<p>The moment of coffee had come. The Unitarian
lighted a black cigar and avidly demanded more reasons
why the Christian religion was immoral.</p>

<p>&quot;Still for the reason that it separates,&quot; continued
Bernal, &quot;separates not only hereafter but here. We
have kings and serfs, saints and sinners, soldiers to kill
one another&mdash;God is still a God of Battle. There is
no Christian army that may not consistently invoke
your God's aid to destroy any other Christian army&mdash;
none whose spiritual guides do not pray to God for help
in the work of killing other Christians. So long as you
have separation hereafter, you will have these absurd
divisions here. So long as you preach a Saviour who
condemns to everlasting punishment for disbelief, so
long you will have men pointing to high authority for
all their schemes of revenge and oppression here.</p>

<p>&quot;Not until you preach a God big enough to save all
can you arouse men to the truth that all must be saved.
Not until you have a God big enough to love all can
you have a church big enough to hold all.</p>

<p>&quot;An Indian in a western town must have mastered
this truth. He had watched a fight between drunken
men in which one shot the other. He said to me, 'When
I see how bad some of my brothers are, I know how
good the Great Spirit must be to love them all!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was&mdash;was he a member of any church?&quot; inquired
the amiable Presbyterian, with a facetious gleam in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't ask him&mdash;of course we know he wasn't a
Presbyterian.&quot;</p>

<p>Hereupon Father Riley and the wicked Unitarian
both laughed joyously. Then the Congregationalist,
gazing dreamily through the smoke of his cigarette,
remarked, &quot;You have omitted any reference to the
great fact of Christianity&mdash;the sacrifice of the Son of
Man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well, I will tell you about it,&quot; answered the
young man quite earnestly, whereat the Unitarian fairly
glowed with wicked anticipations.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us face that so-called sacrifice honestly. Jesus
died to save those who could accept his claim to godship
&mdash;believing that he would go to sit at the right hand
of God to judge the world. But look&mdash;an engineer out
here the other day died a horrible death to save the lives
of a scant fifty people&mdash;their mere physical lives&mdash;died
out of that simple sense of oneness which makes us selfishly
fear for the suffering of others&mdash;died without any
hope of superior exaltation hereafter. Death of this
sort is common. I would not belittle him you call the
Saviour&mdash;as a man he is most beautiful and moving to
me&mdash;but that shall not blind me to the fact that the
sacrificial element in his death is surpassed daily by
common, dull humans.&quot;</p>

<p>A veiled uneasiness was evident on the part of his
listeners, but the speaker gave no heed.</p>

<p>&quot;This spectacle of sacrifice, of devotion to others,
is needed as an uplift,&quot; he went on earnestly, &quot;but
why dwell upon one remote&mdash;obscured by claims of
a God-jugglery which belittle it if they be true&mdash;when
all about you are countless plain, unpretentious men
and women dying deaths and&mdash;what is still greater,&mdash;
living lives of cool, relentless devotion out of sheer
human love.</p>

<p>&quot;Preach this divineness of human nature and you
will once more have a living church. Preach that our
oneness is so real that the best man is forever shackled
to the worst. Preach that sin is but ignorant selfishness,
less admirable than virtue only as ignorance is
less admirable than knowledge.</p>

<p>&quot;In these two plain laws&mdash;the individual's entire
and unvarying selfishness and his ever-increasing
sensitiveness to the sufferings of others&mdash;there is the
promise not of a heaven and a hell, but of a heaven for
all&mdash;which is what the world is more and more emphatically
demanding&mdash;which it will eventually produce even
here&mdash;for we have as little sensed the possibilities of
man's life here as we have divined the attributes of
God himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Once you drove away from your church the big
men, the thinkers, the fearless&mdash;the souls God must
love most truly were it possible to conceive him setting
a difference among his creatures. Now you drive
away even the merely intelligent rabble. The average
man knows your defect&mdash;knows that one who believes
Christ rose from the dead is not by that fact the moral
superior of one who believes he did not; knows,
indeed, of God, that he cannot be a fussy, vain,
blustering creature who is forever failing and forever
visiting the punishment for his failures upon his
puppets.</p>

<p>&quot;This is why you are no longer considered a factor
in civilisation, save as a sort of police-guard upon the
very ignorant. And you are losing this prestige.
Even the credulous day-labourer has come to weigh
you and find you wanting&mdash;is thrilling with his own
God-assurance and stepping forth to save himself
as best he can.</p>

<p>&quot;But, if you would again draw man, heat him, weld
him, hold him&mdash;preach Man to him, show him his own
goodness instead of loading him with that vicious
untruth of his conception in iniquity. Preach to him
the limitless devotion of his common dull brothers to
one another through their sense of oneness. Show
him the common beautiful, wonderful, selfish self-giving
of humanity, not for an hour or for a day, but
for long hard life-times. Preach the exquisite adjustment
of that human nature which must always seek
its own happiness, yet is slowly finding that that happiness
depends on the happiness of all. The lives of
daily crucifixion without hope of reward are abundant
all about you&mdash;you all know them. And if once you
exploit these actual sublimities of human nature&mdash;of
the man in the street&mdash;no tale of devotion in Holy Writ
will ever again move you as these do. And when you
have preached this long enough, then will take place
in human society, naturally, spontaneously, that great
thing which big men have dreamed of doing with their
artificial devices of socialism and anarchism. For
when you have demonstrated the race's eternal oneness
man will be as little tempted to oppress, starve,
enslave, murder or separate his brothers as he is now
tempted to mutilate his own body. Then only will
he love his neighbor as himself&mdash;still with a selfish
love.</p>

<p>&quot;Preach Man to man as a discovery in Godhood.
You will not revive the ancient glories of your Church,
but you will build a new church to a God for whom
you will not need to quibble or evade or apologise.
Then you will make religion the one force, and you will
rally to it those great minds whose alienation has been
both your reproach and your embarrassment. You
will enlist not only the scientist but the poet&mdash;and all
between. You will have a God to whom all confess
instinctively.&quot;</p>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Woman at the End of the Path</h3>

<p>He stopped, noticing that the chairs were pushed
back. There was an unmistakeable air of boredom,
though one or two of the men still smoked thoughtfully.
One of these, indeed&mdash;the high church rector&mdash;
even came back with a question, to the undisguised
apprehension of several brothers.</p>

<p>&quot;You have formulated a certain fashion of belief,
Mr. Linford, one I dare say appealing to minds that
have not yet learned that even reason must submit to
authority; but you must admit that this revelation of
God in the human heart carries no authoritative assurance
of immortality.&quot;</p>

<p>Bernal had been sitting in some embarrassment, dismayed
at his own vehemence, but this challenge stirred him.</p>

<p>&quot;True,&quot; he answered, &quot;but let us thank God for
uncertainty, if it take the place of Christian belief in
a sparsely peopled heaven and a crowded hell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, you know&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know nothing of a future life; but I prefer ignorance
to a belief that the most heinous baby that ever
died in sin is to languish in a state of damnation&mdash;even
'in a wide sense' as our good friend puts it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, surely, that is the first great question of all
people in all ages&mdash;'If a man die shall he live again?'</p>

<p>&quot;Because there has never been any dignified conception
of a Supreme Being. I have tried to tell you
what my own faith is&mdash;faith in a God wiser and more
loving than I am, who, being so, has devised no mean
little scheme of revenge such as you preach. A God
more loving than my own human father, a God whose
plan is perfect whether it involve my living or dying.
Whether I shall die to life or to death is not within
my knowledge; but since I know of a truth that the
God I believe in must have a scheme of worth and dignity,
I am unconcerned. Whether his plan demand extinction
or immortality, I worship him for it, not holding
him to any trivial fancy of mine. God himself can be
no surer of his plan's perfection than I am. I call this
faith&mdash;faith the more perfect that it is without condition,
asking neither sign nor miracle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And life is so good that I've no time to whine. If
this <i>ego</i> of mine is presently to become unnecessary
in the great Plan, my faith is still triumphant. It
would be interesting to know the end, but it's not so
important as to know that I am no better&mdash;only a little
wiser in certain ways&mdash;than yesterday's murderer.
Living under the perfect plan of a perfect Creator, I
need not trouble about hidden details when so many
not hidden are more vital. When, in some far-off
future, we learn to live here as fully and beautifully as
we have power to, I doubt not that in the natural ways
of growth we shall learn more of this detail of life we
call 'death'&mdash;but I can imagine nothing of less consequence
to one who has faith.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw a stanza the other day that tells it well:</p>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
<p>&quot;'We know not whence is life, nor whither death, <br>
 Know not the Power that circumscribes our breath.<br>
 But yet we do not fear; what made us men,<br>
 What gave us love, shall we not trust again?'&quot;</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>While quoting the lines his eyes had been straight
ahead, absently dwelling upon the space between the
slightly parted doors that gave into the next room.
But even as he spoke, the last line faltered and halted.
His glance slowly stiffened out of widening eyes to
the face it had caught there&mdash;a face new, strange,
mesmeric, that all at once enchained him soul and
body. With a splendid, reckless might it assailed
him&mdash;left him dazed, deaf, speechless.</p>

<p>It was the face of Nancy, for the first time all its
guards down. Full upon him flamed the illumined
eyes that made the face a yielding radiance; lifted
a little was the chin of gentle curves, the under lip
caught as if in that quivering eagerness she no longer
breathed&mdash;the face of Nancy, no longer wondering,
Nancy at last compelled and compelling. A moment
the warm light flashed from each to each.</p>

<p>He stopped in a sudden bewilderment, looking
blankly, questioningly at the faces about him. Then
out of the first chaos came the sense of having awakened
from some long, quiet sleep&mdash;of having suddenly
opened his eyes upon a world from which the morning
mists had lifted, to see himself&mdash;and the woman who
stood always at the end of that upward path&mdash;face to
face for the first time. One by one his outer sensations
returned. At first he heard a blurred murmuring,
then he became aware that some of the men were
looking at him curiously, that one of them had addressed
him. He smiled apologetically.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon. I&mdash;I couldn't have been
listening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I merely asked,&quot; repeated Floud, &quot;how you expect
to satisfy humanity with the vague hope that you would
substitute for the Christian promise of eternal life.&quot;</p>

<p>He stared stupidly at the questioner.</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I don't know.&quot; He passed a hand slowly
upward over his forehead. &quot;Really I can hardly
trouble about those matters&mdash;there's so much life to
live. I think I knew a moment ago, but I seem to
have forgotten, though it's doubtless no great loss. I
dare say it's more important to be unafraid of life than
to be unafraid of death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were full of reasons a moment ago,&quot; reminded
Whittaker&mdash;&quot;some of them not uninteresting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was I? Oh, well, it's a small matter&mdash;I've somehow
lost hold of it.&quot; He laughed awkwardly. &quot;It
seems to have come to me just now that those who
study an apple until it falls from its stem and rots
are even more foolish than those who pluck and eat.&quot;</p>

<p>Again he was silent, with a great hidden impatience
for them to be gone. But Whittaker, the wicked
Unitarian, detained them still a moment longer.</p>

<p>&quot;How hardly we should believe in a God who saved
every one!&quot; he breathed softly to the remains of his
cigar.</p>

<p>&quot;Humph! Such a God would be a mere mush of
concession!&quot; retorted Floud, the Baptist.</p>

<p>&quot;And how true,&quot; pursued the unruffled Unitarian,
&quot;that we cannot worship a 'mere mush of concession'
&mdash;how true that our God must hate what we hate, and
punish what we would punish. We might stomach a
God who would save orthodox burglars along with
orthodox bishops, but not one who saved unbaptised
infants and adults of unsound doctrine. Dear, dear,
yes! We must have a God with a little human spite
in Him or He seems to be spineless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A hopeless cynic,&quot; declared the soft voice of the
Catholic&mdash;&quot;it's the Unitarianism working out of him,
mind you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So glad to have met you!&quot; continued the same
good man to Bernal. &quot;Your words are conducive to
thought&mdash;you're an earnest, decent lad at all events.&quot;</p>

<p>But Bernal scarcely heard them or identified the
speakers. They were to him but so many noisy wheels
of the vast machine, each revolving as it must. His
whole body seemed to send electric sparks of repulsion
out to them to drive them away as quickly as might be.
All his energies were centred to one mighty impulse.</p>

<p>At last the door closed and he stood alone with the
disordered table and the pushed back chairs, doggedly
gathering himself. Then he went to the doors and
with a hand to each, pushed them swiftly apart.</p>

<p>She stood at the farther side of the room. She seemed
to have fled there, and yet she leaned toward him
breathless, again with the under lip caught fast in its
quivering&mdash;helpless, piteously helpless. It was this
that stayed him. Had she utterly shrunk away, even
had he found her denying, defiant&mdash;the aroused man
had prevailed. But seeing her so, he caught at the
back of a chair as if to hold himself. Then he gazed
long and exultingly into the eyes yielded so abjectly to
his. For a moment it filled him to see and know, to be
certain that she knew and did not deny. But the man
in him was not yet a reasoning man&mdash;too lately had he
come to life.</p>

<p>He stepped eagerly toward her, to halt only when
one weak white hand faltered up with absurd pretension
of a power to ward him off. Nor was it her hand that
made him stop then. That barrier confessed its frailness
in every drooping line. Again it was the involuntary
submission of her whole poise&mdash;she had actually
leaned a little further toward him when he started, even
as her hand went up. But the helpless misery in her
eyes was still a defense, passive but sufficient.</p>

<p>Then she spoke and his tension relaxed a little, the
note of helpless suffering in her voice making him wince
and fall back a step.</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal, Bernal, Bernal! It hurts me so, hurts me
so! It's the Gratcher&mdash;isn't it hurting you, too? Oh,
it must be!&quot;</p>

<p>He retreated a little, again grasping the back of the
chair with one hand, but there was no restraint in his
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Laugh, Nance, laugh! You know what laughing
does to them!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not to this one, Bernal&mdash;oh, not to this one!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it's only a Gratcher, Nance! I've been asleep
all these years. Now I'm awake. I'm in the world
again&mdash;here, do you understand, before you. And it's
a glad, good world. I'm full of its life&mdash;and I've money
&mdash;think of that! Yesterday I didn't know what money
was. I was going to throw it away&mdash;throw it away as
lightly as I threw away all those good, precious years.
How much it seems now, and what fine, powerful stuff it
is! And I, like a sleeping fool, was about to let it go at
a mere suggestion from Allan.&quot;</p>

<p>He stopped, as if under the thrust of a cold, keen
blade.</p>
<a name="illp304"></a>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="images/illp304.jpg"><img src="images/illp304.jpg"
alt="&quot;He gazed long and exultingly ...&quot;" width="600" border="0"></a><br>
&quot;He gazed long and exultingly into the eyes yielded so abjectly to his.&quot;</div>

<p>&quot;Allan&mdash;Allan!&quot; he repeated dazedly while the look
of pain deepened in the woman's eyes. He stared back
at her dumbly. Then another awakening became
visible in him and he laughed awkwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;It's funny, Nance&mdash;funny&mdash;and awful! Do you
know that not until I spoke his name then had a thought
of Allan come to me? Can you comprehend it? I
can't now. But it's the truth. I woke up too suddenly.
Allan&mdash;Allan&mdash;.&quot; It sounded as if he were
trying to recall some forgotten personality. &quot;Oh,
Allan!&quot;</p>

<p>The last was more like a cry. He fell into the chair
by which he had stood. And now the woman erected
herself, coming forward to stand before him, her head
bowed, her hands convulsively interlocked.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you see it all, Bernal? Is it plain now? Oh,
how it tortured me&mdash;that last Gratcher&mdash;the one we
make in our own image and yet make to be perfect. It
never hurt me before, but now I know why. It couldn't
hurt me so long as I looked it straight in the eye&mdash;but
just now my eyes had to fall before it, and all in a second
it was tearing me to pieces. That's the only defense
against this last Gratcher, Bernal, to look it in the eyes
unafraid. And oh, it hurts so&mdash;and it's all my own
miserable fault!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's your goodness, Nance.&quot; He spoke very
quietly now. &quot;Only the good have a Gratcher that
can't be laughed away. My own was late in coming.
Your Gratcher has saved us.&quot;</p>

<p>He stood up and took her unresisting hands in both
his own. They rested there in peace, yielding themselves
like tired children to caring arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Now I shall be healed,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It will take me longer, Nance. My hurt is more
stubborn, more complicated. I can't help it. Something
in me resists. I see now that I know too much&mdash;
too much of you, too much of&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She saw that he must have suffered some illumination
upon Allan. There was a look of bitter comprehension
in his face as he broke off. She turned away from it.</p>

<p>When, an hour later, Allan came in, he found them
chatting easily of the few people of St. Antipas
that Bernal had met. At the moment, they were discussing
Mrs. Wyeth, whose face, Bernal declared, was of a rare
perfection. Nance turned to her husband.</p>

<p>&quot;You must thank Bernal,&quot; she said, &quot;for entertaining
your guests this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wouldn't if he knew what I said&mdash;or how it must
have bored them. One thing, Nance, they won't meet
here again until you swear I've gone!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal's heart is right, even if his theology doesn't
always please me,&quot; said his brother graciously, examining
some cards that lay on the table. &quot;I see Mrs.
Wyeth has called,&quot; he continued to Nancy, looking up
from these.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. She wanted me to see her sister, poor Mrs.
Eversley, who is ill at her house. I promised to look
in to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've just been telling Nance how beautiful I think
Mrs. Wyeth is,&quot; said Bernal. &quot;She's rare, with that
face of the low-browed Greek. It's one of the memories
I shall take back to my Eve-less Eden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She <i>is</i> beautiful,&quot; said Nancy. &quot;Of course her
nose is the least bit thin and long, but it rather adds zest
to her face. Now I must dress for dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>When Nancy had gone, Bernal, who had been speaking
with a marked lightness of tone, turned to Allan
with an equally marked seriousness.</p>

<p>&quot;Old chap, you know about that money of mine&mdash;
of Grandfather's?&quot;</p>

<p>Allan instantly became attentive.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, there's no hurry about that&mdash;you must
take time to think it over,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p>&quot;But there <i>is</i> hurry! I shouldn't have waited so
long to make up my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;Then you <i>have</i> made up your mind?&quot; questioned
his brother, with guarded eagerness.</p>

<p>&quot;Definitely. It's all yours, Allan. It will help
you in what you want to do. And not having it will
help me to do what I want to do&mdash;make it simpler,
easier. Take it&mdash;and for God's sake be good to
Nancy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't tell you how you please me, Bernal. Not
that I'm avid for money, but it truly <i>seems</i> more in
accord with what must have been grandfather's real
wish. And Nancy&mdash;of course I shall be good to her&mdash;
though at times she seems unable to please me.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a sanctified displeasure in his tone, as
he spoke of Nancy. It caused Bernal to turn upon
him a keen, speculative eye, but only for a moment.
And his next words had to do with matters tangible.
&quot;To-morrow I'll do some of the business that can
be done here. Then I'll go up to Edom and finish
the transfers that have to be made there.&quot; After a
brief hesitation, he added: &quot;Try to please <i>her</i> a bit,
Allan. That's all.&quot;</p>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">In Which the Mirror is Held up to Human Nature</h3>

<p>When, the next day, Nancy went to pay her promised
visit to Mrs. Eversley, the rectory was steeped
in the deep household peace of mid-afternoon. Both
Allan and Bernal had gone out soon after luncheon,
while Aunt Bell had withdrawn into the silence, there
to meditate the first letters of the alphabet of the inexpressible,
to hover about the pleasant line that divides
the normal from the subliminal.</p>

<p>Though bruised and torn, Nancy was still grimly upright
in the eye of duty, still a worthy follower of orthodox
ways. Buried in her own eventful thoughts in that
mind-world where love is born and dies, where beliefs
rise and perish but no sound ever disturbs the stillness,
she made her way along the shaded side of the street
toward the Wyeth residence. Not until she had
passed several doors beyond the house did she recall
her errand, remember that her walk led to a goal, that
she herself had matters in hand other than thinking,
thinking, thinking.</p>

<p>Retracing her steps, she rang the bell and asked for
Mrs. Eversley. Before the servant could reply, Mrs.
Wyeth rustled prettily down the hall from the library
at the back. She wore a gown of primrose yellow.
An unwonted animation lighted the cold perfection
of her face, like fire seen through ice.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>So</i> glad to see you!&quot; she said with graceful effusion&mdash;
&quot;And the Doctor? And that queer, fascinating,
puzzling brother of yours, how are they? So glad!
Yes, poor sister keeps to her room and you really
mustn't linger with me an instant. I'm not even going
to ask you to sit down. Go right up. Her door's at
the end of the hall, you know. You'll comfort the
poor thing beautifully, you dear!&quot;</p>

<p>She paused for breath, a vivid smile taking the place
of words. Mrs. Linford, rendered oddly, almost
obstinately reserved by this excessive cordiality, was
conscious of something unnatural in that smile&mdash;a too
great intensity, like the greenness of artificial palms.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you so much for coming, you angel,&quot; she
went on playfully, &quot;for doubtless I shall not be visible
when you go. You see Donald's off in the back of
the house re-arranging whole shelves of wretched,
dusty books and he fancies that he must have my
suggestions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The door at the end of the hall!&quot; she trilled in
sweet but unmistakable dismissal, one arm pointing
gracefully aloft from its enveloping foam of draperies,
that same too-intense smile upon the Greek face that
even Nancy, in moments of humane expansion, had
admitted to be all but faultless. And the latter, wondering
not a little at the stiff disposition to have her quickly
away, which she had somehow divined through all the
gushing cordiality of Mrs. Wyeth's manner, went on
upstairs. As she rapped at Mrs. Eversley's door,
the bell of the street door sounded in her ears.</p>

<p>Somewhat less than an hour after, she came softly
out again, opening and closing the door noiselessly.
So effectually had she soothed the invalid, that the
latter had fallen into a much-needed sleep, and Nancy,
eager to escape to that mind-world where the happenings
are so momentous and the silence is so tense, had
crept like a mouse from the room.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs she paused to gather up her
skirts. Then her ears seemed to catch the sound of
voices on the floor below and she remained motionless
for a second, listening. She had no desire to encounter
for the second time the torrent of Mrs. Wyeth's manner,
no wish to meet unnecessarily one so disagreeably
gifted in the art of arousing in her an aversion of which
she was half ashamed.</p>

<p>No further sound greeted her straining ears, and,
deciding that the way was clear, she descended the
thickly carpeted stairs. Near the bottom, opposite
the open doors of the front drawing-room, she paused
to look into the big mirror on the opposite wall.
As she turned her head for a final touch to the back of
her veil, her eyes became alive to something in that
corner of the room now revealed to her by the mirror
&mdash;something that held her frozen with embarrassment.</p>

<p>Though the room lay in the dusk of drawn curtains,
the gown of Mrs. Wyeth showed unmistakably
&mdash;Mrs. Wyeth abandoned to the close, still embrace
of an unrecognized man.</p>

<p>Distressed at the awkwardness of her position, Nancy
hesitated, not knowing whether to retreat or go forward.
She had decided to go on, observing nothing&mdash;and of
course she <i>had</i> observed nothing save an agreeable
incident in the oft impugned domesticity of Mr. and
Mrs. Wyeth&mdash;when a further revelation arrested her.</p>

<p>Even as she put her foot to the next step, the face of
Mrs. Wyeth was lifted and Mrs. Wyeth's big eyes fastened
upon hers through the impartial mirror. But
their expression was not that of the placid matron
observed in a passage of conjugal tenderness. Rather,
it was one of acute dismay&mdash;almost fear. Poor Mrs.
Weyth, who had just said, &quot;Doubtless I shall not be
visible when you go!&quot;</p>

<p>Even as she caught this look, Nancy started down
the remaining steps, her cheeks hot from her own
wretched awkwardness. She wanted to hurry&mdash;to
run; she might still escape without having reason to
suspect that the obscured person was other than he
should be in the opinion of an exacting world. Then,
as her hand was at the door, while the silken rustling
of that hurried disentanglement was in her ears, the
voice of Wyeth sounded remotely from the rear of the
house. It seemed to come from far back in the library,
removed from them by the length of the double drawing-rooms
&mdash;a comfortable, smooth, high-pitched voice&mdash;
lazy, drawling&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <i>Linford!</i>&quot;</p>

<p><i>Linford!</i> The name seemed to sink into the stillness
of the great house, leaving no ripple behind. Before
an answer to the call could come, she had opened the
great door and pulled it sharply to behind her.</p>

<p>Outside, she lingered a moment as if in serenely
absent contemplation of the street, with the air of one
who sought to recall her next engagement. Then,
gathering up her skirts, she went leisurely down the
steps and passed unhurriedly from the view of those
dismayed eyes that she felt upon her from the Wyeth
window.</p>

<p>On the avenue she turned north and was presently
alone in a shaded aisle of the park&mdash;that park whose
very trees and shrubs seem to have taken on a hard,
knowing look from having been so long made the recipients
of cynical confidences. They seemed to understand
perfectly what had happened, to echo Wyeth's
high-pitched, friendly drawl, with an added touch of
mockery that was all their own&mdash;&quot;Oh&mdash;Linford!&quot;</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="ChapterXVIIC"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class="totoc">
<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">For the Sake of Nancy</h3>

<p>It was toward six o'clock when she ascended the
steps of the rectory. Bernal, coming from the opposite
direction, met her at the door. Back of his glance,
as they came together, was an intimation of hidden
things, and at sight of him she was smitten by an electric
flash of wonder. The voice of Wyeth, that friendly,
untroubled voice, she now remembered had called to no
specific Linford. In the paralysis of embarrassment
that had seized her in that darkened hallway, she had
failed to recall that there were at least two Linfords in
existence. In an instant her inner world, wrought
into something like order in the past two hours, was
again chaos.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Nance&mdash;you look like night, when there are
no stars&mdash;what is it?&quot; He scanned her with an assumption
of jesting earnestness, palpably meant to conceal
some deeper emotion. She put a detaining hand on
his arm as he was about to turn the key in the
lock.</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal, I haven't time to be indirect, or beat about,
or anything&mdash;so forgive the abruptness&mdash;were you at
Mrs. Wyeth's this afternoon?&quot;</p>

<p>His ear caught the unusual note in her voice, and he
was at once concerned with this rather than with her
question.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, what is it, Nance&mdash;what if I was? Are you
seeing another Gratcher?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal, quick, now&mdash;please! Don't worry me
needlessly! Were you at Mrs. Wyeth's to-day?&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes searched his face. She saw that he was
still either puzzled or confused, but this time he
answered plainly,</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;I haven't seen that most sightly cold lady
to-day&mdash;more's the pity!&quot;</p>

<p>She breathed one quick little sigh&mdash;it seemed to him
strangely like a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you couldn't have been.&quot; She laughed a
little laugh of secrets. &quot;I was only wondering foolish
wonders&mdash;you know how Gratchers must be humoured
right up to the very moment you puff them away with
the deadly laugh.&quot;</p>

<p>Together they went in. Bernal stopped to talk
with Aunt Bell, who was passing through the hall as
they entered; while Nancy, with the manner of one
not to be deflected from some set purpose, made straight
for Allan's study.</p>

<p>In answer to her ominously crisp little knock, she
heard his &quot;Come!&quot; and opened the door.</p>

<p>He sat facing her at his desk, swinging idly from
side to side in the revolving chair, through the small
space the desk permitted. Upon the blotter before
him she saw that he had been drawing interminable
squares, oblongs, triangles and circles, joining them
to one another in aimless, wandering sequence&mdash;his
sign of a perturbed mind.</p>

<p>He glanced up with a look of waiting defiance which
she knew but masked all his familiar artillery.</p>

<p>Instantly she determined to give him no opportunity
to use this. She would end matters with a rush. He
was awaiting her attack. She would make none.</p>

<p>&quot;I think there is nothing to say,&quot; she began quickly.
&quot;I could utter certain words, but they would mean
one thing to me and other things to you&mdash;there is no
real communication possible between us. Only remember
that this&mdash;to-day&mdash;matters little&mdash;I had already
resolved that sooner or later I must go. This only
makes it necessary to go at once.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned to the door which she had held ajar. At
her words he sat forward in his chair, the yellow
stars blazing in his eyes. But the opening was not the
one he had counted upon, and before he could alter his
speech to fit it, or could do more than raise a hand to
detain her, she had gone.</p>

<p>He sat back in his chair, calculating how to meet this
mood. Then the door resounded under a double
knock and Bernal came in.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, old boy, I'll be off to-night. The lawyer is
done with me here and now I'll go to Edom and finish
what's to be done there. Then in a few days I'll be
out of this machine and back to the ranche. You
know I've decided that my message to the world would
best take the substantial form of beef&mdash;a message which
no one will esteem unpractical.&quot;</p>

<p>He paused, noting the other's general droop of gloom.</p>

<p>&quot;But what's the trouble, old chap? You look done
up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal&mdash;it's all because I am too good-hearted,
too unsuspecting. Being slow to think evil of others,
I foolishly assume that others will be equally charitable.
And you don't know what women are&mdash;you don't know
how the sentimental ones impose upon a man in my
office. I give you my word of honour as a man&mdash;my
word of <i>honour</i>, mind you!&mdash;there never has been a
thing between us but the purest, the most elevated&mdash;
the loftiest, most ideal&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, old chap&mdash;I shall have to take the car
ahead, you know, if you won't let me on this one....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;as pure a woman as God ever made, while as for
myself, I think my integrity of purpose and honesty of
character, my sense of loyalty should be sufficiently
known&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, old boy&mdash;&quot; Bernal's face had lighted with a
sudden flash of insight&mdash;&quot;is it&mdash;I don't wish to be indiscreet&mdash;
but is it anything about Mrs. Wyeth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you <i>do</i> know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, except that Nance met me at the door
just now and puzzled me a bit by her very curious manner
of asking if I had been at the Wyeth's this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>What</i>?&quot; The other turned upon him, his eyes
again blazing with the yellow points, his whole figure
alert. &quot;She asked you <i>that&mdash;Really</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you said&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'No'&mdash;of course&mdash;and she mumbled something
about having been foolish to think I could have been.
You know, old man, Nance was troubled. I could
see that.&quot;</p>

<p>His brother was now pacing the floor, his head bent
from the beautifully squared shoulders, his face the
face of a mind working busily.</p>

<p>&quot;An idiot I was&mdash;she didn't know me&mdash;I had only
to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Bernal interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you talking to yourself, or to me?&quot;</p>

<p>The rector of St. Antipas turned at one end of his
walk.</p>

<p>&quot;To both of us, brother. I tell you there has been
nothing between us&mdash;never anything except the most
flawless idealism. I admit that at the moment Nancy
observed us the circumstances were unluckily such
that an excitable, morbidly suspicious woman might
have misconstrued them. I will even admit that a
woman of judicial mind and of unhurried judgments
might not unreasonably have been puzzled, but I would
tear my heart open to the world this minute&mdash;'Oh, be
thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not
escape calumny!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I follow you, old chap, Nancy observed some
scene this afternoon in which it occurred to her that I
might have been an actor.&quot; There was quick pain, a
sinking in his heart.</p>

<p>&quot;She had reason to know it was one of us&mdash;and if I
had denied it was I&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>see</i>&mdash;why didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought she must surely have seen me&mdash;and
besides&quot;&mdash;his voice softened with affection&mdash;&quot;do you
think, old chap, I would have shifted a misunderstanding
like that on to <i>your</i> shoulders. Thank God, I am
not yet reduced to shirking the penalties of my own
blameless acts, even when they will be cruelly misconstrued.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you should have done so&mdash;It would
mean nothing to me, and everything to you&mdash;to that
poor girl&mdash;poor Nance&mdash;always so helpless and wondering
and so pathetically ready to <i>believe</i>! She didn't
deserve that you take it upon yourself, Allan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;no, don't urge! I may have made mistakes,
though I will say that few men of my&mdash;well, my attractions!
Why not say it bluntly?&mdash;few men of my attractions,
placed as I have been, would have made so few&mdash;
but I shall never be found shirking their consequences
&mdash;it is not in my nature, thank God, to let another bear
the burden&mdash;I can always be a man!&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, old boy&mdash;you must think of poor Nancy&mdash;
not of me!&quot; Again he felt the hurt of her suspicion.</p>

<p>&quot;True&mdash;compassion requires that I think of her
rather than of my own pride&mdash;and I have&mdash;but, you
see, it's too late. I committed myself before I knew
she didn't <i>know</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let her believe it is still a mistake&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no&mdash;it would be trickery&mdash;and it's impracticable
&mdash;I as good as confessed to her, you see&mdash;unless
&quot;&mdash;he brightened here and stopped in his walk&mdash;&quot;unless
she could be made to believe that I meant to shield
you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's it! Really, you are an executor, Allan!
Now we'll put the poor girl easy in her mind again.
I'll tell her you did it to shield me. You know it's
important&mdash;what Nancy thinks of you, old chap&mdash;
she's your wife&mdash;and&mdash;it doesn't matter a bit how
meanly&mdash;she thinks of me&mdash;of course not. I dare say
it will be better for me if she <i>does</i> think meanly of me&mdash;
I'll tell her at once&mdash;what was it I did?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;no&mdash;she wouldn't believe you now. I dislike
to say this, Bernal, but Nancy is not always so
trusting as a good woman should be&mdash;she has a habit of
wondering&mdash;but&mdash;mind you, I could only consent to
this for the sake of her peace of mind&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand perfectly, old chap&mdash;it will help the
peace of mind of all of us, I begin to see&mdash;hers and
mine&mdash;and yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, if she can be made to suspect this other
aspect of the affair without being told directly&mdash;ah!&mdash;
here's a way. Turn that messenger-call. Now listen&mdash;
I will have a note sent here addressed to you by a certain
woman. It will be handed to Nancy to give to you.
She will observe the writing&mdash;and she will recognise
it,&mdash;she knows it. You will have been anxious about
this note&mdash;expecting it&mdash;inquiring for it, you know.
Get your dinner now, then stay in your room so the
maid won't see you when the note comes&mdash;she will have
to ask Nance where you are&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>At dinner, which Bernal had presently with Aunt
Bell and two empty seats, his companion regaled him
with comments upon the development of the religious
instinct in mankind, reminding him that should he
ever aspire to a cult of his own he would find Boston
a more fertile field than New York.</p>

<p>&quot;They're so much broader there, you know,&quot; she
began. &quot;Really, they'll believe anything if you manage
your effects artistically. And that is the trouble with
you, Bernal. You appeal too little to the imagination.
You must not only have a novelty to preach nowadays,
but you must preach it in a spectacular manner. Now,
that assertion of yours that we are all equally selfish
is novel and rather interesting&mdash;I've tried to think of
some one's doing some act to make himself unhappy
and I find I can't. And your suggestion of Judas
Iscariot and Mr. Spencer as the sole inmates of hell is
not without a certain piquancy. But, my dear boy, you
need a stage-manager. Let your hair grow, wear a
red robe, do healing&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed protestingly. &quot;Oh, I'm not a prophet,
Aunt Bell&mdash;I've learned that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you could be, with proper managing. There's
that perfectly stunning beginning with that wild
healing-chap in the far West. As it is now, you make
nothing of it&mdash;it might have happened to anybody and
it never came to anything, except that you went off
into the wilderness and stayed alone. You should tell
how you fasted with him in a desert, and how he told
you secrets and imparted his healing power to you.
Then get the reporters about you and talk queerly so
that they can make a good story of it. Also live on
rice and speak with an accent&mdash;<i>any</i> kind of accent
would make you more interesting, Bernal. Then preach
your message, and I'd guarantee you a following of
thousands in New York in a month. Of course they'd
leave you for the next fellow that came along with a
key to the book of Revelations, or a new diet or something,
but you'd keep them a while.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Bell paused, enthusiastic, but somewhat out of
breath.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll quit, Aunt Bell&mdash;that's enough&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Spencer is an example for you. Contrast his
hold on the masses with Mrs. Eddy's, who appeals to
the imagination. I'm told by those who have read
his works that he had quite the knack of logic, and
yet the President of Princeton Theological Seminary
preaches a sermon in which he calls him 'the greatest
failure of the age.' I read it in this morning's paper.
His text was, 'Ye believe in God, believe also in me.'
You see, there was an appeal to the imagination&mdash;the
most audacious appeal that the world has ever known
&mdash;and the crowd will be with this clergyman who uses
it to refute the arguments of a man who worked hard
through forty years of ill-health to get at the mere dry
common-sense of things. If Jesus had descended to
logic, he'd never have made a convert. But he appealed
magnificently to the imagination, and see the
result!&quot;</p>

<p>His mind had been dwelling on Allan's trouble, but
now he came back to his gracious adviser.</p>

<p>&quot;You do me good, Aunt Bell&mdash;you've taken all that
message nonsense out of me. I suppose I <i>could</i> be one
of them, you know&mdash;one of those fellows that get into
trouble&mdash;if I saw it was needed; but it isn't. Let the
men who can't help it do it&mdash;they have no choice.
Hereafter I shall worry as little about the world's salvation
as I do about my own.&quot;</p>

<p>When they had finished dinner he let it be known that
he was not a little anxious concerning a message that
was late in arriving, and he made it a point, indeed, that
the maid should advise Mrs. Linford to this effect,
with an inquiry whether she might not have seen
the delayed missive.</p>

<p>Then, after a word with Allan, he went to his room
and from his south window smoked into the night&mdash;
smoked into something approaching quietude a mind
that had been rebelliously running back to the bare-armed
girl in dusky white&mdash;the wondering, waiting girl
whose hand had trembled into his so long ago&mdash;so many
years during which he had been a dreaming fool, forgetting
the world to worship certain impalpable
gods of idealism&mdash;forgetting a world in which it was the
divinely sensible custom to eat one's candy cane instead
of preserving it superstitiously through barren years!</p>

<p>He knew that he had awakened too late for more than
a fleeting vision of what would have made his life full.
Now he must be off, up the path again, this time knowing
certainly that the woman would never more stand
waiting and wondering at the end, to embitter his renunciations.
The woman was definitely gone. That was
something, even though she went with that absurd,
unreasoning, womanish suspicion. And he had one
free, dear look from her to keep through the empty
days.</p>

<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">The Fell Finger of
Calumny Seems to be Agreeably Diverted</h3>

<p>Shut in his study, the rector of St. Antipas paced the
floor with nicely measured steps, or sat at his desk to
make endless squares, circles, and triangles. He was
engrossed in the latter diversion when he heard the
bell sound below. He sat back to hear the steps of the
maid, the opening of the door; then, after an interval,
her steps ascending the stairs and stopping at his own
door; then her knock.</p>

<p>&quot;A letter for Mr. Bernal, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>He glanced at the envelope she held, noting its tint.</p>

<p>&quot;He's not here Nora. Take it to Mrs. Linford. She
will know where he is.&quot;</p>

<p>He heard her go down the hall and knock at another
door. She was compelled to knock twice, and then
there was delay before the door opened.</p>

<p>He drew some pages of manuscript before him and
affected to be busy at a work of revision, crossing out a
word here, interlining one there, scanning the result
with undivided attention.</p>

<p>When he heard a knock he did not look up, but said,
&quot;Come!&quot; Though still intent at his work, he knew
that Nancy stood there, looking from the letter to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Nora said you sent this letter to me&mdash;it's for
Bernal&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He answered, still without looking up,</p>

<p>&quot;I thought he might be with you, or that you might
know where he was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't.&quot;</p>

<p>He knew that she studied the superscription of the
envelope.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, leave it here on my desk till he comes. I sent
it to you only because I heard him inquiring if a letter
had not come for him&mdash;he seemed rather anxious about
some letter&mdash;troubled, in fact&mdash;doubtless some business
affair. I hoped this might be what he was expecting.&quot;</p>

<p>His eyes were still on the page before him, and he
crossed out a word and wrote another above it, after a
meditative pause. Still the woman at the door hesitated.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you chance to notice the address on the envelope?&quot;</p>

<p>He glanced at her now for the first time, apparently
in some surprise: &quot;No&mdash;it is not my custom to study
addresses of letters not my own. Nora said it was for
Bernal and he had seemed really distressed about some
letter or message that didn't come&mdash;if you will leave it
here&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to hand it to him myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you like.&quot; He returned to his work, crossing
out a whole line and a half with broad, emphatic marks.
Then he bent lower, and the interest in his page seemed
to redouble, for he heard the door of Bernal's room
open. Nancy called:</p>

<p>&quot;Bernal!&quot;</p>

<p>He came to the door where she stood and she stepped
a little inside so that he might enter.</p>

<p>&quot;I am anxious about a letter. Ah, you have it!&quot;</p>

<p>She was scanning him with a look that was acid to
eat out any untruth in his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;it just came.&quot; She held it out to him. He
looked at the front of the envelope, then up to her half-shut
eager eyes&mdash;eyes curiously hardened now&mdash;then
he blushed flagrantly&mdash;a thorough, riotous blush&mdash;and
reached for the letter with a pitiful confusion of manner,
not again raising his uneasy eyes to hers.</p>

<p>&quot;I was expecting&mdash;looking&mdash;for a message, you
know&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;this is it&mdash;thank you very much,
you know!&quot;</p>

<p>He stammered, his confusion deepened. With the
letter clutched eagerly in his hand he went out.</p>

<p>She looked after him, intently. When he had shut
his own door she glanced over at the inattentive Allan,
once more busy at his manuscript and apparently unconscious
of her presence.</p>

<p>A long time she stood in silence, trying to moderate the
beating of her heart. Once she turned as if to go, but
caught herself and turned again to look at the bent
head of Allan.</p>

<p>At last it seemed to her that she could trust herself to
speak. Closing the door softly, she went to the big
chair at the end of the desk. As she let herself go into
this with a sudden joy in the strength of its supporting
arms, her husband looked up at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>She did not speak, but returned his gaze; returned it,
with such steadiness that presently he let his own eyes
go down before hers with palpable confusion, as if fearing
some secret might lie there plain to her view. His
manner stimulated the suspicion under which she now
seemed to labour.</p>

<p>&quot;Allan, I must know something at once very clearly.
It will make a mighty difference in your life and in
mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it you wish to know?&quot; His glance was
oblique and his manner one of discomfort, the embarrassed
discomfort of a man who fears that the real
truth&mdash;the truth he has generously striven to withhold
&mdash;is at last to come out.</p>

<p>&quot;That letter which Bernal was so troubled about
came from&mdash;from that woman&mdash;how could I avoid
seeing that when it was handed to me? Did you know
it, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Nancy&mdash;I knew&mdash;of course&mdash;I knew he
expected&mdash;I mean the poor boy told me&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Here
he broke off in the same pitiful confusion that had
marked Bernal's manner at the door&mdash;the confusion of
apprehended deceit. Then he began again, as if with
gathered wits&mdash;&quot;What was I saying? I know nothing
whatever of Bernal's affairs or his letters. Really, how
should I? You see, I have work on my mind.&quot; As if
to cover his awkwardness, he seized his pen and hastily
began to cross out a phrase on the page before him.</p>

<p>&quot;Allan!&quot; Though low, it was so near a cry that he
looked up in what seemed to be alarm. She was leaning
forward in the chair, one hand reaching toward him
over the desk, and she spoke rapidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Allan, I find myself suspecting now that you tried
to deceive me this afternoon&mdash;that Bernal did, also,
incredible as it sounds&mdash;that you tried to take the
blame of that wretched thing off his shoulders. That
letter to him indicates it, his own pitiful embarrassment
just now&mdash;oh, an honest man wouldn't have looked as
he did!&mdash;your own manner at this instant. You are
both trying&mdash;Oh, tell me the truth now!&mdash;you'll never
dream how badly I need it, what it means to my whole
life&mdash;tell me, Allan&mdash;for God's sake be honest this
instant&mdash;my poor head is whirling with all the lies!
Let me feel there is truth somewhere. Listen. I
swear I'll stay by it, wherever it takes me&mdash;here or away
from here&mdash;but I must have it. Oh, Allan, if it should
be in you, after all&mdash;Allan! dear, <i>dear</i>&mdash;Oh! I do see
it now&mdash;you <i>can't</i> deceive&mdash;you <i>can't</i> deceive!&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly at first his head bent under her words, bent in
cowardly evasion of her sharp glance, the sidelong
shiftings of his eyes portraying him, the generous liar,
brought at last to bay by his own honest clumsiness.
Then, as her appeal grew warmer, tenderer, more
insistent, the fine head was suddenly erected and proud
confession was written plainly over the glowing face&mdash;
that beautiful contrition of one who has willed to bear
a brother's shame and failed from lack of genius in the
devious ways of deceit.</p>

<p>Now he stood nobly from his chair and she was
up with a little loving rush to his arms. Then, as he
would have held her protectingly, she gently pushed
away.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't&mdash;don't take me yet, dear&mdash;I should be crying
in another moment&mdash;I'm so&mdash;so <i>beaten</i>&mdash;and I want
not to cry till I've told you, oh, so many things! Sit
again and let us talk calmly first. Now why&mdash;<i>why</i> did
you pretend this wretched thing?&quot;</p>

<p>He faced her proudly, with the big, honest, clumsy
dignity of a rugged man&mdash;and there was a loving quiet
in his tones that touched her ineffably.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Bernal had told me his&mdash;his <i>contretemps</i>. The
rest is simple. He is my brother. The last I remember
of our mother is her straining me to her poor breast
and saying, 'Oh, take care of little Bernal!'&quot; Tears
were glistening in his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;From the very freedom of the poor boy's talk about
religious matters, it is the more urgent that his conduct
be irreproachable. I could not bear that even you
should think a shameful thing of him.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him with swimming eyes, yet held her
tears in check through the very excitement of this splendid
new admiration for him.</p>

<p>&quot;But that was foolish&mdash;quixotic&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will never know, little woman, what a brother's
love is. Don't you remember years ago I told you that
I would stand by Bernal, come what might. Did you
think that was idle boasting?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you were willing to have me suspect <i>that</i> of
you!&quot;</p>

<p>He spoke with a sad, sweet gentleness now, as one
might speak who had long suffered hurts in secret.</p>

<p>&quot;Dearest&mdash;dear little woman&mdash;I already knew that
I had been unable to retain your love&mdash;God knows I
tried&mdash;but in some way I had proved unworthy of it.
I had come to believe&mdash;painful and humiliating though
that belief was&mdash;that you could not think less of me&mdash;
your words to-night proved that I was right&mdash;you
would have gone away, even without this. But at
least my poor brother might still seem good to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you poor, foolish, foolish, man&mdash;And yet,
Allan, nothing less than this would have shown you
truly to me. I can speak plainly now&mdash;indeed I must,
for once. Allan, you have ways&mdash;mannerisms&mdash;that
are unfortunate. They raised in me a conviction that
you were not genuine&mdash;that you were somehow false.
Don't let it hurt now, dear, for see&mdash;this one little unstudied,
impetuous act of devotion, simple and instinctive
with your generous heart, has revealed your true
self to me as nothing else could have done. Oh, don't
you see how you have given me at last what I had to
have, if we were to live on together&mdash;something in you
to <i>hold</i> to&mdash;a foundation to rest upon&mdash;something I can
know in my heart of hearts is stable&mdash;despite any outward,
traitorous <i>seeming</i>! Now forever I can be loving,
and loyal, in spite of all those signs which I see at
last are misleading.&quot;</p>

<p>Again and again she sought to envelope him with
acceptable praises, while he gazed fondly at her from
that justified pride in his own stanchness&mdash;murmuring,
&quot;Nance, you please me&mdash;you <i>please</i> me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you see, dear? I couldn't reach you before.
You gave me nothing to believe in&mdash;not even God.
That seeming lack of genuineness in you stifled my
soul. I could no longer even want to be good&mdash;and
all that for the lack of this dear foolish bit of realness
in you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one can know better than I that my nature is
a faulty one, Nance&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say unfortunate, Allan&mdash;not faulty. I shall never
again believe a fault of you. How stupid a woman can
be, how superficial in her judgments&mdash;and what stupids
they are who say she is intuitive! Do you know, I
believed in Bernal infinitely more than I can tell you,
and Bernal made me believe in everything else&mdash;in
God and goodness and virtue and truth&mdash;in all the good
things we like to believe in&mdash;yet see what he did!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear, I know little of the circumstances,
but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't <i>that</i>&mdash;I can't judge him in that&mdash;but this I
must judge&mdash;Bernal, when he saw I did not know who
had been there, was willing I should think it was you. To
retain my respect he was willing to betray you.&quot; She
laughed, a little hard laugh, and seemed to be in pain.
&quot;You will never know just what the thought of that
boy has been to me all these years, and especially this
last week. But now&mdash;poor weak Bernal! Poor <i>Judas</i>,
indeed!&quot; There was a kind of anguished bitterness
in the last words.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear, try not to think harshly of the poor boy,&quot;
remonstrated Allan gently. &quot;Remember that whatever
his mistakes, he has a good heart&mdash;and he is my
brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! you big, generous, good-thinking boy, you&mdash;
Can't you see that is precisely what he <i>lacks</i>&mdash;a good
heart? Oh, dearest, I needed this&mdash;to show Bernal
to me not less than to show you to me. There were
grave reasons why I needed to see you both as I see you
this moment.&quot;</p>

<p>There were steps along the hall and a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>&quot;It must be Bernal,&quot; he said&mdash;&quot;he was to leave
about this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't see him again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just this once, dear&mdash;for <i>my</i> sake! Come!&quot;</p>

<p>Bernal stood in the doorway, hat in hand, his bag at
his feet. With his hat he held a letter. Allan went
forward to meet him. Nancy stood up to study the
lines of an etching on the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;I've come to say good-bye, you know.&quot; She heard
the miserable embarrassment of his tones, and knew,
though she did not glance at him, that there was a
shameful droop to his whole figure.</p>

<p>Allan shook hands with him, first taking the letter
he held.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye&mdash;old chap&mdash;God bless you!&quot;</p>

<p>He muttered, with that wretched consciousness of
guilt, something about being sorry to go.</p>

<p>&quot;And I don't want to preach, old chap,&quot; continued
Allan, giving the hand a farewell grip, &quot;but remember
there are always two pairs of arms that will never be
shut to you, the arms of the Church of Him who died
to save us,&mdash;and my own poor arms, hardly less loving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, old boy&mdash;I'll go back to Hoover&quot;&mdash;
he looked hesitatingly at the profile of Nancy&mdash;&quot;Hoover
thinks it's all rather droll, you know&mdash;Good-bye, old
boy! Good-bye, Nancy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear, Bernal is saying good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned and said &quot;good-bye.&quot; He stepped
toward her&mdash;seeming to her to slink as he walked&mdash;but
he held out his hand and she gave him her own, cold,
and unyielding. He went out, with a last awkward
&quot;Good-bye, old chap!&quot; to Allan.</p>

<p>Nancy turned to face her husband, putting out her
hands to him. He had removed from its envelope the
letter Bernal had left him, and seemed about to put it
rather hastily into his pocket, but she seized it playfully,
not noting that his hand gave it up with a certain
reluctance, her eyes upon his face.</p>

<p>&quot;No more business to-night&mdash;we have to talk. Oh,
I must tell you so much that has troubled me and made
me doubt, my dear&mdash;and my poor mind has been up
and down like a see-saw. I wonder it's not a wreck.
Come, put away your business&mdash;there.&quot; She placed
the letter and its envelope on the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Now sit here while I tell you things.&quot;</p>

<p>An hour they were there, lingering in talk&mdash;talking
in a circle; for at regular intervals Nancy must return
to this: &quot;I believe no wife ever goes away until there
is absolutely no shred of possibility left&mdash;no last bit
of realness to hold her. But now I know your stanchness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, Nance&mdash;I can't tell you how much you
please me.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. They looked at
each other bewildered.</p>

<p>&quot;The telephone, sir,&quot; said the maid in response to
Allan's tardy &quot;Come in.&quot;</p>

<p>When he had gone, whistling cheerily, she walked
nervously about the room, studying familiar objects
from out of her animated meditation.</p>

<p>Coming to his desk, she snuggled affectionately into
his chair and gazed fondly over its litter of papers. With
a little instinctive move to bring somewhat of order to
the chaos, she reached forward, but her elbow brushed
to the floor two or three letters that had lain at the edge
of the desk.</p>

<p>As she stooped to pick up the fallen papers the letter
Bernal had left lay open before her, a letter written in
long, slanting but vividly legible characters. And then,
quite before she recognised what letter it was, or could
feel curious concerning it, the first illuminating line of
it had flashed irrevocably to her mind's centre.</p>

<p>When Allan appeared in the doorway a few minutes
later, she was standing by the desk. She held the letter
in both hands and over it her eyes flamed&mdash;blasted.</p>

<p>Divining what she had done, his mind ran with
lightning quickness to face this new emergency. But
he was puzzled and helpless, for now her hands fell and
she laughed weakly, almost hysterically. He searched
for the key to this unnatural behaviour. He began,
hesitatingly, expecting some word from her to guide
him along the proper line of defense.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure, my dear&mdash;if you had only&mdash;only trusted
me&mdash;implicitly&mdash;your opinion of this affair&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice she ceased to laugh, stiffening
into a wild, grim intensity.</p>

<p>&quot;Now I can look that thing straight in the eyes and
it can't hurt me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the eyes?&quot; he questioned, blankly.</p>

<p>&quot;I can <i>go</i> now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will make me the laughing-stock of this town!&quot;</p>

<p>For the first time in their life together there was the
heat of real anger in his voice. Yet she did not seem
to hear.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&mdash;that last terrible Gratcher can't hurt me
now.&quot;</p>

<p>He frowned, with a sulky assumption of that dignity
which he felt was demanded of him.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand you!&quot;</p>

<p>Still the unseeing eyes played about him, yet she
heard at last.</p>

<p>&quot;But <i>he</i> will&mdash;<i>he</i> will!&quot; she cried exultingly, and
her eyes were wet with an unexplained gladness.</p>

<a href="#Toc3">[back to Table of Contents]</a></div>

<h3 style="font-variant: small-caps;">A Mere Bit of Gossip</h3>

<p>The Ministers' Meeting of the following Tuesday
was pleasantly enlivened with gossip&mdash;retained, of
course, within seemly bounds. There was absent the
Reverend Dr. Linford, sometime rector of St. Antipas,
said lately to have emerged from a state of spiritual
chrysalis into a world made new with truths that were
yet old. It was concerning this circumstance that discreet
expressions were oftenest heard during the
function.</p>

<p>One brother declared that the Linfords were both
extremists: one with his absurdly radical disbelief in
revealed religion; the other flying at last to the Mother
Church for that authority which he professed not to find
in his own.</p>

<p>Another asserted that in talking with Dr. Linford
now, one brought away the notion that in renouncing
his allegiance to the Episcopal faith he had gone to the
extreme of renouncing marriage, in order that the
Mother Church might become his only bride. True,
Linford said nothing at all like this;&mdash;the idea was
fleeting, filmy, traceable to no specific words of
his. Yet it left a track across the mind. It seemed
to be the very spirit of his speech upon the subject.
Certainly no other reason had been suggested for the
regrettable, severance of this domestic tie. Conjecture
was futile and Mrs. Linford, secluded in her country
home at Edom, had steadfastly refused, so said the public
prints, to give any reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>His soup finished, the Reverend Mr. Whittaker
unfolded the early edition of an evening paper to a page
which bore an excellent likeness of Dr. Linford.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll read you some things from his letter,&quot; he said,
&quot;though I'll confess I don't wholly approve his taste
in giving it to the press. However&mdash;here's one bit:</p>

<p>&quot;'When I was ordained a priest in the Episcopal
Church I dreamed of wielding an influence that would
tend to harmonise the conflicting schools of churchmanship.
It seemed to me that my little life might be of
value, as I comprehended the essentials of church
citizenship. I will not dwell upon my difficulties.
The present is no time to murmur. Suffice it to say,
I have long held, I have taught, nearly every Catholic
doctrine not actually denied by the Anglican formularies;
and I have accepted and revived in St. Antipas
every Catholic practice not positively forbidden.</p>

<p>&quot;But I have lately become convinced that the Anglican
orders of the ministry are invalid. I am persuaded
that a priest ordained into the Episcopal Church
cannot consecrate the elements of the Eucharist in a
sacrificial sense. Could I be less than true to my inner
faith in a matter touching the sacred verity of the Real
Presence&mdash;the actual body and blood of our Saviour?</p>

<p>&quot;After conflict and prayer I have gone trustingly
whither God has been pleased to lead me. In my
humble sight the only spiritual body that actually
claims to teach truth upon authority, the only body
divinely protected from teaching error, is the Holy,
Catholic and Roman Church.</p>

<p>&quot;For the last time I have exercised my private judgment,
as every man must exercise it once, at least, and
I now seek communion with this largest and oldest
body of Christians in the world. I have faced an emergency
fraught with vital interest to every thinking man.
I have met it; the rest is with my God. Praying that
I might be adorned with the splendours of holiness,
and knowing that the prayer of him that humbleth himself
shall pierce the clouds, I took for my motto this sentence
from Huxley: 'Sit down before fact as a little
child; be prepared to give up every preconceived notion;
follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses
Nature leads.' Presently, God willing, I shall be in
communion with the See of Rome, where I feel that
there is a future for me!&quot;</p>

<p>The reader had been absently stabbing at his fish
with an aimless fork. He now laid down his paper to
give the food his entire attention.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; began Floud, &quot;I say one brother is quite
as extreme as the other.&quot;</p>

<p>Father Riley smiled affably, and begged Whittaker
to finish the letter.</p>

<p>&quot;Your fish is fresh, dear man, but your news may be
stale before we reach it&mdash;so hasten now&mdash;I've a presentiment
that our friend goes still farther afield.&quot;</p>

<p>Whittaker abandoned his fish with a last thoughtful
look, and resumed the reading.</p>

<p>&quot;May I conclude by reminding you that the issue
between Christianity and science falsely so called has
never been enough simplified? Christianity rests
squarely on the Fall of man. Deny the truth of Genesis
and the whole edifice of our faith crumbles. If we be
not under the curse of God for Adam's sin, there was
never a need for a Saviour, the Incarnation and the
Atonement become meaningless, and our Lord is
reduced to the status of a human teacher of a disputable
philosophy&mdash;a peasant moralist with certain delusions
of grandeur&mdash;an agitator and heretic whom the authorities
of his time executed for stirring up the people. In
short, the divinity of Jesus must stand or fall with the
divinity of the God of Moses, and this in turn rests upon
the historical truth of Genesis. If the Fall of man be
successfully disputed, the God of Moses becomes a
figment of the Jewish imagination&mdash;Jesus becomes man.
And this is what Science asserts, while we of the outer
churches, through cowardice or indolence&mdash;too often,
alas! through our own skepticism&mdash;have allowed Science
thus to obscure the issue. We have fatuously thought
to surrender the sin of Adam, and still to keep a Saviour
&mdash;not perceiving that we must keep both or neither.</p>

<p>&quot;There is the issue. The Church says that man is
born under the curse of God and so remains until
redeemed, through the sacraments of the Church, by
the blood of God's only begotten Son.</p>

<p>&quot;Science says man is not fallen, but has risen steadily
from remote brute ancestors. If science be right&mdash;
and by <i>mere evidence</i> its contention is plausible&mdash;then
original sin is a figment and natural man is a glorious
triumph over brutehood, not only requiring no saviour
&mdash;since he is under no curse of God&mdash;but having every
reason to believe that the divine favour has ever attended
him in his upward trend.</p>

<p>&quot;But if one finds <i>mere evidence</i> insufficient to outweigh
that most glorious death on Calvary, if one
regards that crucifixion as a tear of faith on the world's
cold cheek of doubt to make it burn forever, then one
must turn to the only church that safeguards this rock
of Original Sin upon which the Christ is builded. For
the ramparts of Protestantism are honeycombed with
infidelity&mdash;and what is most saddening, they are giving
way to blows from within. Protestantism need no
longer fear the onslaughts of atheistic outlaws: what
concerns it is the fact that the stronghold of destructive
criticism is now within its own ranks&mdash;a stronghold
manned by teachers professedly orthodox.</p>

<p>&quot;It need cause little wonder, then, that I have found
safety in the Mother Church. Only there is one compelled
by adequate authority to believe. There alone
does it seem to be divined that Christianity cannot
relinquish the first of its dogmas without invalidating
those that rest upon it.</p>

<p>&quot;For another vital matter, only in the Catholic
Church do I find combated with uncompromising boldness
that peculiarly modern and vicious sentimentality
which is preached as 'universal brotherhood.' It is a
doctrine spreading insidiously among the godless masses
outside the true Church, a chimera of visionaries who
must be admitted to be dishonest, since again and
again has it been pointed out to them that their doctrine
is unchristian&mdash;impiously and preposterously unchristian.
Witness the very late utterance of His Holiness,
Pope Pius X, as to God's divine ordinance of prince and
subject, noble and plebeian, master and proletariat,
learned and ignorant, all united, indeed, but not in
<i>material</i> equality&mdash;only in the bonds of love to help
one another attain their <i>moral</i> welfare on earth and
their last end in heaven. Most pointedly does his
Holiness further rebuke this effeminacy of universal
brotherhood by stating that equality exists among the
social members only in this: that all men have their
origin in God the Creator, have sinned in Adam, and
have been equally redeemed into eternal life by the
sacrifice of our Lord.</p>

<p>&quot;Upon these two rocks&mdash;of original sin and of prince
and subject, riches and poverty&mdash;by divine right, the
Catholic Church has taken its stand; and within this
church will the final battle be fought on these issues.
Thank God He has found my humble self worthy to
fight upon His side against the hordes of infidelity and
the preachers of an unchristian social equality!&quot;</p>

<p>There were little exclamations about the table as
Whittaker finished and returned at last to his fish. To
Father Riley it occurred that these would have been
more communicative, more sentient, but for his presence.
In fact, there presently ensued an eloquent
silence in lieu of remarks that might too easily have
been indiscreet.</p>

<p>&quot;Pray, never mind me at all, gentlemen&mdash;I'll listen
blandly whilst I disarticulate this beautiful bird.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say one is quite as extreme as the other,&quot; again
declared the discoverer of this fact, feeling that his
perspicacity had not been sufficiently remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;I dare say Whittaker is meditating a bitter cynicism,&quot;
suggested Father Riley.</p>

<p>&quot;Concerning that incandescent but unfortunate young
man,&quot; remarked the amiable Presbyterian&mdash;&quot;I trust
God's Providence to care for children and fools&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And yet I found his remarks suggestive,&quot; said the
twinkling-eyed Methodist. &quot;That is, we asked for
the belief of the average non-church-goer&mdash;and I dare
say he gave it to us. It occurs to me further that he
has merely had the wit to put in blunt, brutal words
what so many of us declare with academic flourishes.
We can all name a dozen treatises written by theologians
ostensibly orthodox which actually justify his
utterances. It seems to me, then, that we may profit
by his blasphemies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; demanded Whittaker, with some bluntness.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah&mdash;that is what the Church must determine. We
already know how to reach the heathen, the unbookish,
the unthinking&mdash;but how reach the educated&mdash;the
science-bitten? It is useless to deny that the brightest,
biggest minds are outside the Church&mdash;indifferentists
or downright opponents of it. I am not willing to
believe that God meant men like these to perish&mdash;I
don't like to think of Emerson being lost, or Huxley,
or Spencer, or even Darwin&mdash;Question: has the Church
power to save the educated?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, I know one that has never lacked it,&quot; purled
Father Riley.</p>

<p>&quot;There's an answer to you in Linford's letter,&quot;
added Whittaker.</p>

<p>&quot;Gentlemen, you jest with me&mdash;but I shall continue
to feel grateful to our slightly dogmatic young friend for
his artless brutalities. Now I know what the business
man keeps to himself when I ask him why he has lost
interest in the church.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a large class we can't take from you,&quot; said
Father Riley&mdash;&quot;that class with whom religion is a
mode of respectability.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you can't take our higher critics, either&mdash;
more's the pity!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On my word, now, gentlemen,&quot; returned the
Catholic, again, &quot;that was a dear, blasphemous young
whelp! You know, I rather liked him. Bless the
soul of you, I could as little have rebuked the lad as I
could punish the guiltless indecence of a babe&mdash;he was
that shockingly na&iuml;f!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is undoubtedly the just fruit of our own toleration,&quot;
repeated the high-church rector.</p>

<p>&quot;And he stands for our knottiest problem,&quot; said the
Presbyterian.</p>

<p>&quot;A problem all the knottier, I suspect,&quot; began
Whittaker&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't I <i>tell</i> you?&quot; interrupted Father Riley. &quot;Oh,
the outrageous cynic! Be braced for him, now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was only going to suggest,&quot; resumed the wicked
Unitarian, calmly, &quot;that those people, Linford and his
brother&mdash;and even that singularly effective Mrs.
Linford, with her inferable views about divorce&mdash;you
know I dare say that they&mdash;really you know&mdash;that they
possess the courage of&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Their <i>convictions</i>!&quot; concluded little Floud, impatient
alike of the speaker's hesitation and the expected platitude.</p>

<p>&quot;No&mdash;I was about to say&mdash;the courage&mdash;of ours.&quot;</p>

<p>A few looked politely blank at this unseasonable
flippancy. Father Riley smiled with rare sweetness and
murmured, &quot;So cynical, even for a Unitarian!&quot; as if
to himself in playful confidence.</p>

<p>But the amiable Presbyterian, of the cheerful auburn
beard and the salient nose, hereupon led them tactfully
to safe ground in a discussion of the ethnic Trinities.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
